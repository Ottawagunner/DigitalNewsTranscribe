MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 13:32,anyone who conquers anything has the right to think highly of themselves.... like you know because he(they) went there(anywhere) and risked his(their) lives and came out the other side. i dont discount the gallic populations suffering but lets be honest...he is a great man and he deserves to be remembered. without folks like Caesar Tem√ºjin Alexander Charles the Great Hitler etc what a weird world we would (more than likely) still live in. War progresses human civilization admittedly at the expense of a certain populace its just a shame we could never ask them (victims) if it was worth it....
ManifestMagnetist,history,2015-03-15 13:51,War progresses human civilization......? War destroys everthing human society stands for.....you are speaking some serious newspeak I appreciate you being humble about it though.   Ask the populaces of France or italy like Louis the 14 being beheaded by the french revolution or Mussolini being hung by a meat hook by the Italians about what they think of great men :)
MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 14:05,i only say war progresses human civ in a way that expediates the process. humans would have found each other without armies on the move we would have traded other things along the way (not just war materials taxes etc) and exchanged culture as well. i would argue though that without war we probably wouldnt have cell phones or tvs or radio or modern infastructure or modern farming techniques and logistics in governing hundreds of millions per state.  also i dont know who considers Mussolini a great man he was kind of weak willed IMO and couldnt even hold a stick to Hitler(not even the greatest man of his Generation[Churchill]) so i wont draw those comparisons:)
Hinmatoowyalahtqit,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 20:36,Have you checked out this recent (somewhat) relevant thread?  * [Why is the Holocaust so focused on in education compared to other tragedies of the time such as the Mao Zedong era or Stalin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2z04y5/why_is_the_holocaust_so_focused_on_in_education/)
nickanda,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 20:41,thanks! somewhat answers the question but still looking for specific factors that have led Hitler to be remembered as well....Hitler whilst Stalin got off so much more lightly! 
partytemple,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 22:00,The U.S. cared because they had been employing the policy of containment the idea that global communism must be subdued. The Soviet Union under the ideology of Stalinism wanted a worldwide communist revolution because only then would there be a proletariat state without class struggle and maintained by class equality and socialism. This ideology conflicted with the Americans. The U.S. believed that capitalism but not necessarily pure capitalism was the most functional model of economics. Communism is a direct rejection of capitalism. Communists believed that in order to constructed a pure communist world the proletariat must rise against capitalists destroy capitalism and develop a purely proletariat state. Ideologically this is a threat to the U.S.. American-Soviet ambassador George Kennan warned President Truman about the Soviet's masterplan. Kennan thought the Soviet ideology was a threat to traditional American ideals and a poor representation of the Russian people's beliefs. Moreover he believed that the Soviet government was oppressive regime with a delusional philosophy. Truman took Kennan's advise and established his Truman Doctrine which warned the American people about the Soviet's totalitarian ideology.  National ideology however was not the only reason the U.S. joined in the Vietnam War. It may be the main reason but the U.S. also faced a lot of domestic political pressure in its decision to fight and remain in a war against the Vietcong. 
bowlabrown,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 23:04,Thomas Mann also lost his chair for his opposition to the nazis. Bruder Hitler is a short piece well worth the read.
lsop,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 23:40,This was one of the reasons Mussolini was so loved. A church in Canada even painted [a mural](http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca/collection/details/dicea2012_0024_0001) commemorating the event.  
RegnierundRilke,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 4:39,Just an addendum to the above recommendations - Dwyer's series in fact includes a *third* volume covering his exile and last years though I don't think it has been published yet.  It's tremendously difficult to recommend the 'best' biography as Kieslowskifan says: apart from maybe Hitler I'd go as far as to say that probably more biographies have been published on him than any other historical figure (excepting perhaps some individuals of antiquity who may have been granted cursory portraits in various Medieval and Renaissance writings and continue to be worked on today) at least as far as I can think of. There are literally thousands and thousands of books on Napoleon and I certainly don't claim to have read all in the slightest. Indeed in the last few years innumerable biographies have been published in English alone - not to mention others in French German etc. - to the extent that it's quite literally impossible to always keep up. But then it also depends on what *kind* of biography you're looking for: those which stress the military details or focus on his intimate life or with a chronological emphasis on his earlier reigning or later days or even sheer polemic (those extreme contributions to the long-running heroic general/brutal expansionist debate).   Not to throw you off of course  it simple helps to know what you'd be interested in reading even in terms of length and detail. To begin with perhaps refer to an overarching review of various recent biographies  e.g. Charles Esdaile's comparative assessment of five relatively fresh ones: http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1707.
2wicky,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 7:29,The situation in Belgium was as with most things Belgian quite complicated and very controversial. I'll try to give a quick summery.  When the Germans invaded the Belgian government ordered King Leopold III to flee and go in exile with them. Leopold III however wasn't on good terms with the current government of the time. He saw such a move as cowardly and decided to stay with his troops and continue fighting agains the Germans.  When the situation of the Belgian forces became unattainable at the battle of Dunkirk Leopold III surrendered to the Germans. He being a constitutional king doing so without having consulted the government in exile first was scene as an act of treason. Despite being warned of the surrender in advanced the British weren't too happy about it either as this lead to one of their flanks being exposed.  In the mean time Leopold III was placed under house arrest in his palace in Laeken by the Nazis. He refused to cooperate with them forcing the Germans to instil a military government instead. After much insistence Leopold III finally managed to get Hitler to meet with him. He had hoped to convince Hitler to make a statement about the future return of independents of Belgium. When Hitler refused to do so it at least became publicly clear that the king wasn't collaborating with the Nazis. But while he was still defending his own countrymen he made no effort to cooperate with the government in exile.   In the later stages of the war he was deported to Germany and then to Austria. After the war it was advised he not return to Belgium as his role during the war remained controversial. In Belgium the south of the country saw him as a traitor the north saw him as a hero.   A referendum was held and a slight majority voted for his return. But when he did return riots broke out and it was clear he was no longer representing the unifying symbol of what it is to be the king of the Belgians. To prevent further unrest let alone civil war he abdicated from the throne and his son became the new king of the Belgians.

marshalofthemark,history,2015-03-16 9:46,Yep great precedent. Nobody else took more than two terms until Roosevelt and I believe it's now illegal.
estherke,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 10:32,I wouldn't quite have put it that way myself. Views differed more according to political than to regional allegiances it just so happened that these tended to overlap. The left-wing parties who had a larger support base in Wallonia were opposed to the King's return  the conservative (catholic) parties were in favour and these had more support in Flanders. Why Wallonia was and is more left-wing has many reasons that we can't go into here.   The conservative rhetoric was that the king was a tragic figure who remained loyal to his people by not leaving the country in a time of need and by doing the best he could in difficult circumstances.  The left-wing rhetoric saw the king as a crypto nazi who hobnobbed with Hitler. He was also much resented for hastily marrying his girlfriend (his first wife had died) when she turned out to be pregnant. This was felt to be a reflection of a dissipated and/or frivolous lifestyle in essence he was living it up with loose women while the POWs languished abroad and the people suffered under the iron heel of the occupier.
Poefi,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:08,after the lost WWI Hungary's partly isolative foreign policy was used to gain political ground and search for new allies. while quitting the League of Nations Hungary joined the Anticomitern-Pact in february 1939 joined the Axis in november 1940 and declared war on the USSR in juni 1941. Hungary was a German ally and was on a good way to become a German vassal but due to its neutral foreign policy and hesitation in war participation was not considered a trustworthy ally. Germany occupied Hungary and tried to push to the east one last time during WWII.  it was more important to Germany that Hungary ally up with them and not with one of their enemies than Hungary's actual military contribution to the war. Hungarians were tolerated but due to their non indo-european language could not be scientically considered as aryans. what would happen to them after Hitler's final vicotry? we will never know for sure.  still in 1935 to suck in its finno-ugric speaking allies (Finland Estonia Hungary) Germany changed the term aryan in official state documents and used person with german or similar blood instead.  Hitler once said its unforgiven that the Budapest with its Attila-breed Huns is the most beautiful city along the Danube and not one Niebelung city  i also read somewhere that G√∂ring wanted to claim the hungarian throne so desperately that he let his family-tree magyarised what went so succesfull that he is still considered a 7th degree √Årp√°d descendant. he also dated his own coronation: just after the final victory.  optionally you can read this article i found in this topic: [G. Baross - Hungary and Hitler](http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/baross/baross00.htm)
Hawkeye117,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:08,Sorry the 'extremely incompetent' remark ended up being very general. But you sort of addressed it. I was referring specifically to the incompetent generals and commanders of WWI who ordered waves-upon-waves of soldiers in what were obviously suicidal attacks. Men like Hamilton and Churchill's Dardanelles farce.   Also I'd just like to add a few questions if I may.   &gt  Hindenburg Mackensen Heeringen Kluck Gallwitz Hutier Mudra Below were all very accomplished commanders and NONE were high ranking aristocrats.   Being in the positions that they were in how were they viewed by the aristocracy who served under/above/with them? Was there discrepancy between aristocratic commanders and non-aristocratic ones? And did their merit and achievement earn them a deal of respect that meant they were also seen as members of the elite?    Also did soldiers of certain units display more of a sense of loyalty to their commanders if they were a part of the aristocracy specifically if they were a royal of the unit's respective region?    And lastly was the Kaiser's role in military affairs to simply be the man who signs off as the highest ranking officer and says Yes go ahead with that offensive etc. Or did he take an active role in the planning and carrying-out of operations? If so was he challenged? Or did his close staff simply refrain from objecting to his plans in fear of reprisal much like that of Hitler.
Venmar,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:34,Nazi viewpoints varied vastly across the races of Europe. Sometimes like Vonadler mentioned they'd change specifically due to the actions of the residing country of the race. Nonetheless racial views were inconsistent.  The Nazi overview of the Latins chiefly Frenchmen Spaniards and Italians varied. Since the latter two were Fascist states Nazi view on them was obviously favorable. However helped by typical French-German animosity and rivalry the Nazi's saw the French probably lukewarm at best they didn't consider the French subhuman or inferior but hardly gave them the respect they deserved.   The Spaniards were described by Hitler as the only Tough Latins and seemed to favour them above all of the rest of the Latin races. Spanish volunteer divisions participated on the Eastern Front primarily the *Blue Division* where Hitler described the Spanish as almost equal to that of German divisions. Undoubtedly Nazi view of the Spanish was favorable both due to Hitlers seeming approval of them and their current government being Fascist.  Can't speak much for the Italians however I imagine that the Nazis didn't view the Italians subhumans just incompetent due to their failure to do well anything really in war on the side of the Axis.  You mentioned the Romanians as Slavs which is incorrect Romanians are latins just like the French Spanish etc. Romania had a decently large population of Gypsies which the Nazis prosecuted and hated. Romanians in general however weren't directly prosecuted or hated. Nonetheless Nazi regard for the Romanians was low as the war went on and continually stripped weapons tanks and supplies from Romanian units to arm German divisions then got mad when the Romanians performed poorly. This was a pattern repeated with other Axis allies too.  The occupied people of the Lowland countries the Dutch and the Belgians were viewed fairly well. They weren't considered subhuman and considered to be somewhat Aryan especially the Dutch whose language was similar to German and their traits similar as well. The Dutch were and are a tall people (an important aspect of Aryan attributes) with a distinctively Germanic language and culture and were therefore looked at fairly. Both were considered viable candidates to be Aryans. The Netherlands was however deeply affected by the latter stages of the war as the Germans continually took supplies and food from the country to feed their own people and troops and the hunting of Jews was very extensive in both Belgium and the Netherlands.  The Scandinavians Swedes and Norwegians were seen as the ideal Aryans and were therefore regarded very highly. Political situations however such as the uncertain response of Sweden to Operation Barbarossa hurt their reputation as none of the Scandinavian races were really fond of the Nazi's. The Danes were among the same level as these.  Now the Slavic races had it much harder. Poles Czechs and Slovaks are all Slavic and the Germans were very harsh with their treatment of them. In the occupied Czech Republic the Germans planned to eventually either remove the Czechs and replace them with Germans or ruthlessly Germanize them. In Poland Poles were murdered and killed alongside their Jewish brethren just for being Slavic. The Germans also planned to do the same in Poland as in the Czech Republic and replace much of Poland with Germans especially lands previously held by Prussia or the German Empire. (In fact in general the Nazis wanted to deport most or at least as many as possible Slavic peoples to Siberia as the Germans believed they'd win over the USSR. The plan was to ruthlessly Germanize what Slavs could be saved and deport the rest to Siberia and replace them with Germans. This was the driving factor behind the German prosecution and attack on the Slavic people as the Germans needed to displace them due to their position in the East which the Nazi's considered to be the living space of the German people.) The Slovaks the only of the three that theoretically fought alongside the Germans were viewed a bit better but were nonetheless battered by Nazi opinion. Since the Poles Czechs and Slovaks made up a fair portion of the Eastern European population German oppression of all three was significant. However this didn't stop the Germans from eventually recruiting Czechs Slovaks and even Poles into their Army and even the Waffen SS. The most successful Panzer ace in the war [Kurt Knispel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Knispel) who scored at least 168 confirmed tank kills with potentially as many as 195 was a Sudeten German from the Czech Republic. Yet since he was from the Czech Republic (and due to his laid back personality and longer har) he was never promoted beyond NCO status. The Russians had it the hardest since they were both communist and slavic which made German persecution of them extremelly violent. Much of the death toll for the Holocaust can be attributed to the killing of Russians on the Eastern Front.  I can't speak much for any of the other races. Nazi opinion realy did depend on the position that the country of the race held. While Bulgarians were Slavic with direct/indirect roots to the Russians the Nazi's didn't directly prosecute or attack them because they didn't want to war with Bulgaria one of their few Allies. While the Balkan races were mostly Slavic Nazi persecution of them was not as severe as that of the Poles and Russians because they partly fell under Italian influence and because they weren't directly in the way or of high importance the Germans wanted to settle lands farther North-West from the Balkans. I have no idea what the Nazi's thought of the Hungarians Portugeese or Swiss. 
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 14:29,&gt  I was referring specifically to the incompetent generals and commanders of WWI who ordered waves-upon-waves of soldiers in what were obviously suicidal attacks. Men like Hamilton and Churchill's Dardanelles farce.  Im not really going to address the misapprehension that attacks during World War I were obviously suicidal  I will leave that to posters such as /u/nmw and /u/elos_ in threads such as these:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t77wz/we_have_all_heard_of_the_mass_infantary_charges/c4k7e10  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16obi4/in_world_war_i_why_would_a_general_ever_order_his/c7xttjg/  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2vgopo/why_did_trench_warfare_stop_after_ww1/  But speaking specifically to the Dardanelles the lesson of that campaign is less that Churchill was an incompetent as it is a cautionary tale about mission creep. The goal of the initial Dardanelles expedition was to use British naval power -- specifically older battleships that could not stand in the line of battle -- to blast a way through the Straits and bring their guns to bear on Constantinople hopefully toppling the Ottoman regime or at least forcing them to terms. (This is not as farfetched as it sounds because one ship *SMS Goeben* had essentially tipped the country into the war.)   The Straits were known to be mined and also to be defended by heavy guns. In the brutal logic of the war Churchill figured that even losing several older battleships with their crews was less bloody in the long term than infantry attacks on the Western front.   The problem with the naval expedition was that the Ottomans had a surprisingly stout interlocking defense both of lines of mines and also of large guns. There's also a pretty significant current in the Strait. So an initial effort by battleships to force their way through was marked by an early defeat (and a bit of timidity on the British part when they discovered the mines). The minesweepers (converted fishing trawlers) the British then bought to the Straits were deeper in draft than the anchored mines which tended to depress morale among the crews of the sweepers. Nevertheless they successfully swept at least two of the lines of mines before fire from shore batteries knocked out several of the minesweepers. At that point they rethought their approach and brought in the *HMS Queen Elizabeth* to try to knock out the shore batteries by firing over the peninsula (from the Aegean side). This was actually fairly successful and the Turkish batteries were running low on shot and becoming desperate before the battle of March 18 in which an undetected minefield sank three of the Franco-British battleships and forced a withdrawal. (It's arguable that had the fleets pressed on the Ottomans might have withdrawn from the peninsula  we will never know. Ottoman morale was wavering and the batteries were nearly silenced  the fleet's withdrawal allowed them to restock and replenish.)    In any case the failure of the ships themselves to be able to knock out the guns led to a call for a landing at the Dardanelles using troops to secure the batteries. At that point the Strait could be swept of mines at the fleet's leisure. Unfortunately that led to Anzac Cove and the bloody fight to follow where far more lives were lost than those on three obsolete battleships.    **tl dr:** The Dardanelles campaign was poorly planned and insufficiently supported but it was not in its conception or aims necessarily wrongheaded. It was like many aspects of WWI in that the technology and tactics of the time had simply fallen behind defensive technology and in which a great loss of life would have to be accepted for even the most basic of gains. 
VoightKampffTest,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 14:48,Perhaps the alleged Business Plot. Retired Marine Major General  and two time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley Butler (author of [War is a Racket!](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html)) and journalist Paul French testified at the House Special Committee on Un-American Activities that a group of powerful businessmen and industrialists had contacted them about a plan to launch a coup against President Franklin Roosevelt.   Butler was a widely admired war hero and they thought he was the man they needed to rally and organize veterans into a movement akin to the Weimar-era Germany Freikorps. Once they had the muscle the plan was to either depose Roosevelt or turn him into their puppet enacting fascistic reforms modeled after those of Mussolini's Italy.   &gt French testified that MacGuire stated **‚ÄúWe need a fascist government in this country to save the Nation from the Communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America. The only men who have patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader. He could organize one million men over night.**  &gt Continuing French stated that during the conversation MacGuire told him about his trip to Europe and of the studies that he had made of the Fascist Nazi and French movements and the parts that the veterans had played in them. &gt ... &gt French further testified that MacGuire considered the movement entirely and tremendously patriotic and that any number of people with big names would be willing to help finance it. French stated that during the course of the conversation MacGuire continually discussed the need of a man on a white horse and quoted MacGuire as having said **We might go along with Roosevelt and then do with him what Mussolini did with the King of Italy.**  &gt MacGuire according to French expressed the belief that half of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars would follow General Butler if he would announce the plan that MacGuire had in mind.  *Testimony of Paul Comly French - Page 21.*  &gt I said The idea of this great group of soldiers then is to sort of frighten him is it?  &gt No no no  not to frighten him. This is to sustain him when others assault him.  &gt He said**You know the President is weak. He will come right along with us.** He was born in this class. He was raised in this class and he will come back. He will run true to form. In the end he will come around. But we have got to be prepared to sustain him when he does.  *Testimony of Maj. Gen. S. D. Butler (Retired) - Page 4*  Again we have very few sources on the existence of the alleged plot beyond the HUAC hearings let alone how far along the conspirators were in serious preparations but if Butler &amp  French's testimony was truthful the Business Plot would doubtless be one of the top candidates.   **Sources**  Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Other Certain Propaganda Activites (PDF Warning)  * [Part 1](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC1.pdf) * [Part 2](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC2.pdf) * [Part 3](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC3.pdf)  [Transcript of the above documents](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/McCormack%E2%80%93Dickstein_Committee#Public_Statement_on_Preliminary_findings_of_HUAC.2C_November_24.2C_1934) 
bemonk,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 16:12,Hitler didn't have to. They basically encouraged themselves.  But your question is oversimplifying. It wasn't just Hitler Youth vs. Scouts  I'm going to get some details wrong but here's how society was split up.  If you were a kid in school and your father was a communist you: Were Red played on the Communist soccer team were a Pioneer and your dad was in the KPD (communist party)  If your father was in the SPD (social democrats) you: Were Light Red (Rose red or pink derogatorily) played on the Soc-Dem soccer team were a Pfadfinder and your dad was in the SPD.  If your dad was a nazi you were: Brown or brown shirt played on the nazi soccer team were with the  Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) and your dad was in the NSDAP.  Everyone was brutal to everyone else. The kids did not mix. Not even KDP and SPD unless playing soccer.  The political divides went from the parents to the children to the schools to every corner of society. Pfadfinder and Pioneer envied the Hitlerjugend because he got a kick-ass dagger and a snazzier uniform... in the 30's there just ended up being less Pfadfinder and Pioneer scouts and more hitler youth scouts.  ...again forgive me on the details. The point is it wasn't just scouts. And yes that totally happened. Hitleryouth's big tactic was being a hard bully.
ErwinRommel_1891,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 17:44,The Battle of Stalingrad ended poorly for many reasons despite such a strong beginning for the Wehrmacht. Some of these are mistakes made by the commanders of the primary German formation the 6th Army and others are due to the Soviet Union‚Äôs 62nd Army and its positive strengths as well as those of its leader General Zhukov.  One of these reasons was the string of bad choices made by the German High Command over the year-long siege. First and possibly most importantly as a basis there was a crucial mistake the Germans made on the first day of the battle. The bombing of the city which required that vast quantities of Wehrmacht bombers and Stukas be drawn from all areas of the front seemed a good idea initially: bomb out the civilians and possible partisans and any garrison soldiers. However this would later become one of the main reasons the city could be held by the Red Army. The completely destroyed ruins meant some areas were near impassable even by foot created conditions where long range fighting was difficult and battles often became close range and even hand to hand and any armoured fighting was instantly pitched in favour of the infantry should they possess anti-armour weapons and equipment (the anti-tank rifle which looked much like a large sniper was used to great effect in these conditions). Another mistake then which ties into this point is that the commanders of 6th Army kept their panzers fighting in the city which was not only wasteful but can be said to be one of the contributing factors to the eventual encirclement of the 6th Army as they were unavailable for recall counteroffensive or repositioning to break out of the trap engaged on 19th November 1942.  The 6th Army was also stretched precariously along the Don River. The single army held the entire stretch of river for over 150 miles and had only a handful of divisions in reserve. Whilst this is alone a problem the main issue is that the flanks of the 6th were protected by two Romanian armies in the north and south as well as an Italian in the north. When the time for the Red Army‚Äôs offensive came her attacking armies in which the 62nd was not included (1st Guards Army 5th Tank Army 21st Army 65th Army 24th Army 66th Army 64th Army 57th Army 51st Army) hit hard around the flanks where the Romanian troops had not the proper equipment nor full-strength division not the morale  and then there were the Italians who were Italian in all military sense and thus had little equipment or morale. In both allied armies the fighting men were also looked upon with disdain from their commanding officers which Erwin Rommel also witnessed in Africa stating that ‚Äúit is as though they are two different species‚Äù (paraphrasing) ‚Äì this did not encourage their soldiers to fight well. The Red Army armoured formations smashed through these Axis-allied armies with little issue (though being early-war Red Army they were still inexperienced forces and suffered surprising casualties considering the calibre of the 6th Army‚Äôs flanks). The fact that as earlier stated there were no German response armoured divisions and few reinforcing German formations plus a hesitance to act on behalf of the German command all meant that there was a quick if costly assault and encirclement carried out by a large Russian force on an overextended Axis formation which in the end could simply not break out effectively (other reasons out with the boundaries of the question exist as to why the formation capitulated and was completely destroyed in the end).   The shear tenacity and sometimes brilliance of Red Army soldiers cannot be overlooked though. The resolve of their men was impeccable for much of the battle though many still did dessert under incredibly stressful conditions and many were executed for this. Red Army tactics also evolved to fight in a war which mirrored WW1 in brutality but was almost purely urban ‚Äì hand to hand combat  eight-man fireteams armed with knives SMGs and snipers  the use of bombed out buildings as key fortresses and choke points  traversing sewers  hugging the enemy lines (the front line was never more than 100 yards from the Germans‚Äô so that the German artillery had to be very particular and careful in danger of friendly fire)  jury-rigged weapons and equipment  traps and contraptions MacGuyver would be proud of (AA-guns made of wood and stolen German MGs which were adept at taking down and scaring off Stukas)  and of course pure resolve. The battles were so intense that they were known as Rattenkrieg (rat war) to the Wehrmacht soldiers. The tenacity of the defending 62nd Army at Stalingrad and their ability to hold onto the west bank of the Volga river (by the skin of their teeth for the most part) as well as simply having the bodies to throw at the problem ensured that the Red Army continued to hold onto the key city until the two Red Army operations Little Saturn (cancelled in favour of operation Uranus) and Uranus could be enacted to relieve and recapture the city proper.  Finally the aid of the Allies whilst not often acknowledged gave the Red Army the aid it needed. Actual fighting equipment give through the lend lease was considered inferior and ineffective by the Red Army the most famous being that they thought the M4 Sherman was utter tripe but Allied grain meat and Studebaker Ford Willys et cetera trucks and jeeps made all the difference in the capability to fight longer and achieve greater strategic reach. The trucks especially were useful and over 600000 were delivered over the course of the war. They were used to carry artillery pieces across the field quickly and proved invaluable in the offensive at Stalingrad as they did in so many battles.  Sources:  Anthony Beevor‚Äôs ‚ÄòStalingrad‚Äô.

AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 18:26,It should be added that after 1933 all rival youth organisations were gradually abolished in favor of the HJ and the BDM (Bund Deutscher M√§del the version for girls). This happened first to the left-leaning organisations then to the politically neutral ones and at last to the christian organisations.  24 members of the HJ died before 1933 in politically inspired violence. How many people died on the other side I don't know. The movie Hitlerjunge Quex portrays the death of one Hitlerjunge as a heroic sacrifice.  One thing that should be mentioned is that the HJ and the BDM was one of the more popular organisations in Nazi Germany. It did offer children of all social backgrounds the opportunity for sports hiking and advancement like commanding the local group. That this was done with the goal of indoctrination and to prepare the next generation for war is the mirror image.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 18:44,Hitler certainly had an effect on the type of art that was popular during his reign. The most striking example is the exhibition on Entartete Kunst which took place in Munich in 1937 and the exhibition on german art which took place at the same time. The opening speech sums up his idea of art pretty well. The influence also extended to music (with Wagner and Operetten being most popular) architecture (Speer and Germania) and sculpting (Arno Breker).  Having said that I am not aware of Hitler using his personal art for propaganda purposes. However I did find a mention that Hitler made a draft for a swastika flag in 1920 (http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46408313.html). This seems to be an exception however.  As he became more famous after the first World War Hitler tried to suppress sources on his life before the war. In 1938 he tried to rebuy all paintings done by him. The existence as a poor and not very talented or famous painter did not fit with his status as dictator anymore.
DiddyDom007,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 19:23,It may well have made it worse but to my knowledge anti-Semitism is an ancient prejudice. Jews have been persecuted for millennia- the Romans the Crusades the Nazis just to name the most famous.  Without going into too much detail the Arab-Jewish conflict is one which runs deep in the veins of history and Hitler in the Middle East was probably only a very small fragment of the anti-Semitism there.  Hope this helps.
teddybear202,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 20:02,In 'Bloodlands' Snyder writes that in one particularly bad German POW camp there were more Soviet deaths in a day than all the Western Allies suffered throughout the war in camps. As far as the reason in Mein Kampf Hitler said he estimated 45 million Slavs would have to be 'eliminated' and the rest enslaved. Red Army troops were made aware of this through propaganda and knew the war was absolutely to the death no POWs could expect to be treated according to the Geneva Convention. 
ldwr011,history,2015-03-16 21:53,So basically a little after Germany broke their non-aggression pact against the USSR Germany backed the USSR all the way up to the city of Stalingrad. This city was important to the soviets as it was named after their leader and to give it up would be an embarrassment. So the soviets put out their all and utmost power into protecting Stalingrad. When the Germans fought for Stalingrad they lost to the soviets. This was known as the turning point in the war. This is because from then on the USSR and the other allied forces pushed the Germans to the point of Hitler shooting himself and the war in Europe was done. This was also known as V-E Day. (Victory in Europe Day) 
hatheaded,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 2:15,The Nazi's came to power during a very interesting and dynamic time in the modern art movement. Western art in particular painting had become less representational and more abstract. Hitler who considered himself an artist was a fierce opponent of this type of art and it was suppressed to varying degrees during the Nazi regime. The Nazi regime termed this as degenerate art. Ironically much of the art was confiscated but not actually destroyed - it could be profitably auctioned.  It is also well known that when the Nazis would invade and occupy other nations they would often loot the museums of valuable art much of which made it into the personal vaults of high ranking Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering was particularly notorious in this regard. That may not be relevant for your essay but it does shed considerable background on the venality and greed of some of the Nazi leaders.  The Nazi regime viewed the arts as a propaganda tool and suppressed art that did not directly agree with and support their ideology. They tended to prohibit and suppress modern art not classical works and they did so for political and aesthetic purposes. Obviously works by Jewish artists were particularly suppressed.  ISIS have destroyed works of ancient art on religious grounds and perhaps also as a form of publicity seeking knowing there would be a strong reaction and media coverage of their deeds. They interpret Islam as forbidding any work that represents a living thing as idolatry. Please note this is not a mainstream view of most Islamic thought it is an extreme and very minority view.

International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 5:52,It was essentially a compromise. When the UN Charter was first being drawn up the Soviets had argued for a limited membership one restricted to the 1942 signatories of the UN Declaration. A broader membership which the US was pushing for would potentially see the Soviet Union permanently outvoted by the Western client states and colonial dominions. As the negotiations dragged on one of the Soviet demands became the admission of *all sixteen* constituent Soviet Republics to the General Assembly.  The eventual compromise saw broad membership be adopted but also strengthened the Security Council and permanent members‚Äô veto. This gave Stalin some assurance that the new body wouldn't become an anti-Soviet vehicle in any meaningful sense. As part of the deal the Soviets also got two of their republics (in addition to the USSR proper) admitted to the General Assembly thus strengthening their bloc in that chamber.

International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 8:06,Post-Stalin is not my area of expertise but in terms of living standards once past the harsh Stalin years the Soviet Union followed a similar upwards curve in living standards as Western Europe. Life did indeed get cheerier from the 1950s onwards ‚Äì mortality rates fell nutrition improved housing stock was renewed and increased mechanisation eased the peasant‚Äôs workload. This was part of the Khrushchev drive to improve living standards. So in absolute terms a late Soviet peasant enjoyed significantly better living standards than his late Tsarist counterpart. Which is as to be expected from an industrialised nation.  (This progress had faltered by the late 1980s when mortality rates began to creep upwards again and living standards stagnated. But that‚Äôs outside my comfort zone. Moreover even stagnation would not have devolved )  The question gets a bit more interesting when you look at the *relative* comforts of the Soviet peasantry. After all for all the material progress of the peasantry post-1960 they still lived on collective farms and worked to the state‚Äôs tempo. If we take this into account ie consider the peasant‚Äôs ‚Äòindependence‚Äô then the mid-1920s are worth examining. This was the height of the NEP and probably the high-point of the Russian peasantry: farming their own plots (on commune land) free of noble interference and with little incentive to sell (rather than consume) their produce they would have enjoyed a relatively prosperous life. When compared to the cramped cities at least. The sophisticated (for the time) Soviet nutritional surveys of the period show that during the peak NEP (say 1925-28) the peasants were eating better than they had been in 1913 or 1953.  So it depends on how you cut the question. In terms of material progress (diet life expectancy manufactured goods etc) for an individual peasant then things got progressively better from the late 1950s onwards (to the late 1970s at least). In terms of their position and living standards relative to the urban world then the mid-1920s are where you want to look. What is absolutely clear is that the 1930s are the period in which the peasantry had the worst of both worlds: severely lacking for material comforts (eg food) and suffering intense state repression.  Sources: Stephen Wheatcroft‚Äôs done a fair amount of work on the early decades of Soviet rule. See particularly his *First 35 Years of Soviet Living Standards (2009)* and *The Great Leap Upwards (1999)*. Robert Allen (*Farm to Factory*) would disagree with my assessment of the 1930s somewhat. I‚Äôve taken the vaguer post-Stalin picture from a few general works.
cub1986,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 11:52,The German historian Eberhard J√§ckel wrote an excellent book on Hitler's plans called *Hitler's World View: A Blueprint for Power*. He explained why Hitler felt it necessary to extinguish the Jews. Whereas Marx viewed history as class struggle Hitler instead viewed history as racial struggle. J√§ckel elaborates:  &gt It is on this basis that the programmatic thinker Hitler confirms and defines for the political Hitler the dual yet also unified task of his life. He had to annihilate the Jews thus restoring the meaning of history and within the thus restored nature-intended struggle for existence he at the same time had to conquer new living space for the German people. Each of these tasks was inextricably linked to the other  indeed they were the mutually necessary preconditions for each other. Unless the Jews were annihilated there would very soon no longer be any struggle for living space nor therefore any culture and consequently nations would die out  not just the German nation but ultimately all nations. But if on the other hand the German people failed to conquer new living space it would die out because of that and the Jews would triumph.
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)  it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:26,The parts of Germany gave to Poland was compensation demanded by the Western Allies for taking easter territories of Poland. Today's Kaliningrad Oblast' was to be part of Poland aswell (with the city of Kaliningrad bearing name Kr√≥lewiec) although Stalin changed his mind in the last moment and decided to add this territory to the RSFSR. Lw√≥w which is considered to be the one of the two main (along with Krak√≥w) cities where the Polish elite was being raised has been given to the Ukrainian SSR as it had claim on it and meant that one of the very important places where the polish patriotism could be continiued ceased to exist.  The case of Baltics while might seem complicated was pretty simple. The countries had fairy low population and even though each of them had very different culture with and unlike Ukraine/Belarus had nothing in common with Russia they couldn't pose any real threat. The USSR also played the better safe than sorry card and made the Baltic States a place where Soviet Army officers were sent for retirement. This resulted in fairly large russian minority being still present in these countries today. Stalin did almost the same thing with Crimea although he took a step further there and instead of only moving russian citizens there he expelled most of the Tatar people from there to Siberia in fear of organized resistance (as the Tatar community much like the Poles are known for their ferocity in fights against opressors).  As for the Chechens i fear that although I know a bit of their cause my knowledge is not sufficent to provide you a quality answer. I can only guess that they underestimated them and it serves them right to this day since they have constant insurgency in that area.
Theoroshia,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:20,changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us - are you sure you're being non-biased?
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:34,I guess you could say that but I belive that was the case. France and Great Britain were to attack Germany right away should they invade Poland. Before the attack took place Marshall Pi≈Çsudski insisted that Poland and France should make preventive invasion of Germany due to them ignoring Treaty of Versailles conditions which were dismissed by France. After Germany invaded Poland all that Western Allies did was declare war and take no military action. Everyone in Poland was sure that they only need to hold the invasion for a short time to stall German offensive allowing France and Britain to take necessary action. After Poland was defeated the government on the exile created Polish forces which fought extraordinary in various battles during the war. Battle of Britain was won thanks to Polish and Czechoslovakian pilots (Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. was the words Churchill said after victory). They also fought in Arnhem (6. SBS led by General Sosabowski) in Narvik (1. Polish Independent Highland Brigade) Tobruk (3. Polish Carpathian Infantry Division) and Falaise (1. Armoured Division led by General Maczek). The fought alongside the very people who betrayed their beloved country because they belived that they won't betray them again. They fought to the very end without knowing that the decision to hand Poland to the eastern bloc under russian rule was already made during Yalta Conference. After this all don't you think that betrayal is the correct used word here?

Arebos,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:14,One of the main reasons I can think of would be his relief of General Douglas MacArthur.  MacArthur was a very popular general and national hero during WWII who helped turn the battle in the pacific around after being pushed out of the Philippians.  He was also a distinguished soldier and leader during WWI.  He was even considered a political candidate during the 1940's elections.    However during the push back against the North Korean invasion MacArthur went against express orders in several respects and invaded the North thus instigating Chinese involvement.   Truman removed MacArthur from command in Korea thus receiving a huge political backlash of public support for the decision. He decided not to even run for reelection.   Casey Steven (2008).

stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
aleksey2,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:22,To clarify Ukraine and Belarus didn't get annexed after WW2 but were enlarged in size by seizing land from liberated countries (in quotes cause while they did get liberated from the Nazis it was held against them as though they had a bill to pay to the USSR for the aforementioned liberation). If I understand correctly you're asking why the USSR didn't annex Poland Romania and Bulgaria and instead allowed them to remain independent states on paper. All the while in practice actually fully controlling what those countries got to do via their respective Socialist governments who were puppets of the Kremlin? If that *is* your question then there could be many explanations as to why none of which are good enough to explain everything on their own. Having said that I think two really good reasons as to why are 1) deniability and 2) creating a buffer zone.  **Deniability** - the best of both worlds if your worlds consist solely of 'wanting to exert control' and 'not wanting to pay anything for it'. USSR was all like Who me? Naah bruh I don't control those countries. They are *totally* independent have their own *elected* governments and do as they please.   When you annex a territory you gotta deliver a benefit for the people you're annexing. Romans solved it by giving the conquered Roman citizenship and creating some peace and prosperity (albeit that changed depending on the era of Roman Republic/Empire). In return Romans got to extract/take what they wanted and needed from the new province. It hasn't really changed much - you gotta give the people you're conquering something in return for their freedom. And that's a costly endeavour  something that a war-torn country might not be willing to consider. Instead if what you really want is to control the population AND you can get that control by getting the governments of those countries to do your bidding for you (and to co√∂perate fully with your requests) then you've just achieved control without exerting any serious costs. Now you get what you want and you have to provide **none** of the services and benefits you would have had to if you annexed that same territory.  Btw this all assumes that the territory in question isn't full of oil or any other natural resources. Cause in those cases empires will still want to annex it any *any* cost.   **Buffer zone.** It wasn't exactly clear that a new conflict wasn't going to start after Berlin fell. The West never truly trusted the USSR and vice versa even while they shared the common enemy. With the new enemy soon-to-be gone (or now gone if we're talking about post-may-1945) it wasn't assumed that peace will reign in. The USSR was prepared for a new conflict if it would arise and the bigger the buffer zone between the West and Moscow the better. Now if you can control and coordinate with Polish/Romanian/Bulgarian governments and military without having to spend any money on their citizens then you've achieve your objective. Now you can have a new war and hope that it stays contained within the countries on the periphery of USSR. You get two outcomes from this. Either USSR wins or it loses. In both cases you the USSR hope that the conflict takes place and *stays* in those countries. That way if you have to surrender and pull out you haven't actually lost any territory that's your own. If it's a costly stalemate or if you win by way of 'scorched earth/leave no building standing' tactic of military attack then you just make Poland/Romania/Bulgaria weaker in the process. Now whether you win or lose they will be too poor and bombed out to either be a threat or to stand on their own. If they stay allied to Moscow they'll be even weaker to resists Kremlin's influence. If they flip sides and join the West then the logic is that it would be so costly to rebuild them and that the West would never want to spend the money to do so.  Fundamentally the decisions of WW2 USSR and post-WW2 USSR were made by Stalin a certified lunatic and a deranged psychopath who viewed the world as a constant us vs. them struggle and regarded all human lives with outmost of disregards (obligatory link to what happened to Stalin's own [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Dzhugashvili#Second_World_War)).
JFVarlet,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 18:35,Well it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks more the lower-middle officers especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy even though there's a King Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan on the other hand there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.
beatles-in-space,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 19:00,President Truman had an ambitious domestic agenda which he called the Fair Deal which stalled in front of a Republican-controlled Congress. In the 1948 campaign he ran against the do-nothing Congress which turned out to be a successful political strategy although it didn't improve his legislative prospects. An image of ineffectual leadership is never good.  He also had an ambitious foreign policy agenda which was much more successful. This included the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human Rights Berlin Airlift Truman Doctrine Marshall Plan North Atlantic Treaty and the Korean War. You have to remember that isolationist sentiment was still very strong in the United States. Truman's presidency was crucial because he kept the United States intimately involved in international relations in the post-World War II period. But a substantial faction of Republicans was opposed to some or all of these policies. In particular the Korean War was carried out without a declaration of war and under the auspices of enforcing the UN Charter under UN auspices and with the authority of a UN Security Council resolution. Imagine what that must have meant to a country which 30 years earlier had rejected the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations! And furthermore the war turned into a stalemate in which tens of thousands of American troops were killed. Dwight Eisenhower came into office largely on the back of this issue and the idea that Truman was overextending the country. His corrective was to reign in the Korean War-era defense budget and put much more emphasis on nuclear deterrence creating the Cold War as we know it. It was a sort of return to normalcy (to quote Warren Harding) that the American people were looking for. Eisenhower normalized the Cold War and had a simultaneously more unilateral and more restrained foreign policy.

ChurchillianGrooves,history,2015-03-09 19:57,Sort of agree.  Imperialism was already winding down for a number of reasons  1. Post-colonialism: allows the exploitation of countries without directly taking them over (think Nike factories or Foxconn in Asia)   2. Growing opposition among the population in Imperialist countries (whether due to political ideology or just on a cost basis)  3. Colonies acquiring greater infrastructure and technology making them less dependent on the Imperial powers  4.  Growing nationalism in colonies   5.  Economies becoming more dependent on machinery (and skilled workers) than manpower (as in an agrarian society)  I'm sure there are more but these are the larger reasons I could come up with off the top of my head.  I wouldn't say Hitler caused the end of Imperialism.  WWI and WWII certainly sped up the process though.  While I do agree with you that British and French colonialism were horrible and often glossed over they were no where near as bad as the Nazis or even the Soviets.  Many millions of people were outright killed or starved to death in concentration camps and gulags.  Many of the independence movements in the colonies were already well underway even before WWI so you can't really say that Hitler lead to their independence.  Ho Chi Minh was at the treaty of Versaille at the end of WWI arguing for Vietnamese independence after all.  The Indian independence movement was also active pre WWI.

After the United States entered the war in December 1941 the trickle of immigration virtually dried up just at the time that the Nazi regime began systematically to murder the Jews of Europe.

Bigglesworth_,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 7:01,That's not quite right  Dowding's strategy was to preserve Fighter Command as a force in being to deny the Luftwaffe air superiority rather than to shoot down as many bombers as possible the preferred strategy of e.g. Sholto Douglas but Dowding broadly left tactical decisions to his group commanders. 11 Group's Keith Park prioritised early interception of German raids by whatever fighters could reach them soonest more in line with Dowding's strategy whereas 12 Group's Trafford Leigh-Mallory favoured the Big Wing taking the time to assemble multiple squadrons for a massed attack with some support from Douglas and others at the Air Ministry not least thanks to lobbying from the likes of Douglas Bader backed up by large numbers of claimed kills that in post-war analysis turned out to be wildly optimistic.  There was considerable personal acrimony between Park and Leigh-Mallory and from Leigh-Mallory towards Dowding for giving Park command of 11 Group. There was a famous staff conference on October 17th 1940 concerning Day Fighter Tactics that turned out to be a Big Wing ambush chaired by Douglas with heated discussions primarily between Park and Leigh-Mallory and little input from Dowding concluding that Leigh-Mallory's tactics were correct. Dowding wasn't popular and had been due to be replaced as Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command before the war  he wasn't court-martialed as a result of the October conference but he was rather unceremoniously shuffled out of Fighter Command in November 1940 lack of success in intercepting night raids being the final nail in his coffin.  There was a suggestion that Dowding's silence at the conference was deliberate and that he could have referred to Ultra intelligence to prove that Park's tactics (and by extension Dowding's strategy) were correct but he chose to preserve the Ultra secret. This (and the more general impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain) is disputed by e.g. John Terraine in *The Right of the Line* and Harry Hinsley in *British Intelligence in the Second World War*. According to Sebastian Cox in *A Comparative Analysis of RAF and Luftwaffe Intelligence in the Battle of Britain 1940* Dowding may not even have been aware of the true nature of Ultra at the time as a minute from Churchill on October 16th asked that Cs-in-C of Fighter and Bomber Command be let in on the secret though other accounts suggest he may have known from August.
bang531,history,2015-03-10 9:41,The responsibility for the Korean War falls solely on Stalin. Mao would not have wanted a war so close to China's doorstep. He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea. The UN forces and MacArthur have been warned that any incursion across the Yalu is an act of war and MacArthur was inching to go into China on the back of his successful push back against the North Korean army after the Inchon landing. He was even thinking of using the atomic bomb against China. Of course Truman fired him basically for insubordination when he ignored orders not to expand the war. After all the forces in Korea were there under the auspices of the UN not the US and the mandate was to stop the North Korean not expand the war into China

zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 13:22,His party was by far the largest party in Germany. Hindenburg named him Chancellor due to pressure from his conservative/army buddies who thought they could use Hitler's large number of elected representatives to rule.  IIRC the parliament was completely paralyzed because there was no government that could be formed at that point with an absolute majority so the only way to get anything done was to rule by presidential decree. Everyone wanted a democratic ruler and the conservatives compromised by making a coalition with the nazis where he got the chancellery and they got most of the ministries giving that coalition the elected weight to rule without decree.  So he didn't have absolute majority but it was an impossible feat for the most part to get a majority with tens of parties all getting votes.  source : Rise and fall of the Third Reich
vet_laz,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 13:45,/u/kieslowskifan and /u/international_KB   thank you both for your replies!  @ /u/kieslowskifan  thanks for linking to the research by Harrison I've already started reading and its quite interesting! Add to the fact that its free as well! I had looked online for books on this particular subject but oddly everything I could find (on amazon that is) was in the $100-150 price range. They didn't appear to be text books either? I found that really strange.   I've only just begun to understand the dire situation the Soviets were faced with in 1942. Mainly it has to do with what I've read about the fighting around Moscow and Rzhev in '42. I'm interested to know more about these battles and I'll look into getting books that specifically cover the subject because everything I own and have read so far  overshadows this conflict with what happened in the south during Case Blue and then at Stalingrad. If you have any pointers on reading materials in thus regard I'll gladly take note. Cheers!  @ /u/international_KB  I wanted to say first and foremost that your reply didn't seem offhand or hastily written. I'm not a student or academic so I don't have crazy standards or anything hahaha. No offense to students or academics!  I watched a documentary recently that said government reports from the time stated something like a million freight cars had been shipped east by rail during the initial stages of the invasion. Unofficially it was said that if you had lined up these freight cars from end to end they would have stretched from the original western borders all the way to the Pacific. Whether that claim is true or not I think what was accomplished is nothing short of astonishing. If I'm not mistaken I seem to recall having read that several tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of freight cars were caught in a massive traffic jam further to the east of the Volga in the southern part of the union as they were moved east.  Just let me know if this is covered in the writings by Harrison as I've only just started with them. You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines? To my understanding after the defeats suffered during 1941 and with portions of the war industry having been transported cross country and then needing to be subsequently reestablished the winter and spring portions of 1942 can be seen as perhaps the darkest period for the Red Army. New formations were created to replace the losses sustained the year prior but arming these new units was set back by the situation within the munitions industry as a whole. Something that would have a major effect on the Red Army as they attempted to push the Germans further back from the Moscow area in the first half of '42. Correct?  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  I've taken note of the two books you mentioned and I'll look into purchasing them at a later date. Cheers!    **At that I thank the both of you for helping me further my understanding on the subject!**  *This doesn't have to be answered if its considered trivial or irrelevant but the question is in relation to Soviet agriculture. Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals? When speculating about alternate outcomes of the eastern front I've read the argument that the Soviets would have retreated into Siberia and continued the resistance from there although it doesn't seem like there would be any significant portion of farmland based there beforehand?* 
Serpenz,history,2015-03-10 14:15,&gt  He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The 7th Fleet was sent there after the start of the Korean War. Truman had stood by while Mao had defeated Chiang in mainland China and was ready to allow the same to happen in Taiwan but the invasion of South Korea was one of a number of events that convinced him Mao was an instrument in Soviet global policy rather than an Asian Tito (a nationalist communist independent of Moscow). Note that the fleet was also meant to prevent Chiang from trying to reconquer the mainland.  &gt  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea.  MacArthur's forces didn't cross the Yalu (or Tumen). I'm not entirely sure they actually reached the rivers. But regardless of whether or not US forces were about to cross into Manchuria in 1950 Mao didn't want them at his border.
DatDinkleberg,history,2015-03-10 14:56,The main instigator of the Korean War was Syngman Rhee not Kim Il-Sung nor Stalin he excluded leftists and communists from politics his forces also did the Mungyeong massacre blamed it on communist guerrillas jailed nearly 30000 communists and enrolled nearly 300000 suspected sympathizers in the Bodo League. Kim Il-Sung attacked the South just to free it's people from the oppression of this rightist dictator.
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:15,This is a very post-hoc justification for the use of the atomic bombs and one that was not promulgated officially until 1947. You can read more about this here (the excellent blog of our own /u/restricteddata): http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/08/the-decision-to-use-the-bomb-a-consensus-view/  The whole entry is great but the pertinent responses to your points above are probably:   &gt  It‚Äôs not really clear that Truman ever made much of a ‚Äúdecision‚Äù or regarded the bomb/invasion issue as being mutually exclusive. Truman didn‚Äôt know if the bomb would end the war  he hoped but he didn‚Äôt know couldn‚Äôt know. The US was still planning to invade in November 1945. They were planning to drop as many atomic bombs as necessary. There is no contemporary evidence that suggests Truman was ever told that the causalities would be X if the bomb was dropped and Y if it was not. There is no evidence that prior to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Truman was particularly concerned with Japanese causalities radiation effects or whether the bombs were ethical or not. The entire framing of the issue is ahistorical after-the-fact here. It was war  Truman had atomic bombs  it was taken for granted at that point that they were going to be used.   and   &gt  Personally I don‚Äôt wade into these questions much professionally or even here on the blog. They honestly don‚Äôt interest me very much. Maybe it‚Äôs a sign of how post-post-Cold War I am? I don‚Äôt know. To me it has always seemed like splitting very fine hairs trying to make distinctions without much difference. In my mind the atomic bombings were plainly not ethically very different than the previous firebombings of Japan or Germany. To argue about whether they were justified or not seems to me to be the wrong question ‚Äî a question that misleads us into mistaking what the core issue was.  &gt For me the better question is **under what circumstances do we believe the use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians is justified?**  That gets one into much more interesting ethical territory in my opinion than asking why the bombs were used a question that seems to presume that the motivations are somehow the most important thing to ask about. It also keeps us from having the same old discussion that people have been having for nearly 70 years. Maybe it‚Äôs my post-postness talking here but whether people in the past had *better or worse intentions* **before** *setting a hundred thousand people on fire* seems like the least interesting historical question to pose in the face of such actions.  (emphasis in original) 
quant271,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:17,Stalin made a graduation speech at the Soviet army officers academy in which he told the to expect war with Germany soon.   I don't think Whaley had a direct statement from Stalin about an ultimatum but he had the German records from Intelligence and Diplomacy and some Soviet material which support the inference.  The Germans were trying to push the ultimatum idea as a deception plan.     I'll have to reread that book.  Since the book came out before the collapse of the Soviet Union it would be very interesting to look at this again in light of the documents available now.
stillbevens,history,2015-03-10 16:00,Churchill was one of the architects of this operation btw
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 16:09,This election was actually a political loss for the NSDAP furthermore the SPD and KPD were gradually cooperating with each-other which was a potential immediate future threat to them. This naturally changed with Hitlers appointment to Chancellor at the urgings of various leading members of Government and it only took a year for him to consolidate power using his new position.
zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 16:22,What????  The Socialists actually despised the Communists MOST of all. They perceived them as their main threat even though the nazi star had started shining again and quickly moved past them. Without question something that helped Hitler gain seats and eventually the chancellery since his 2 main opponents were divided and unwilling to cooperate.  source : same as above
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 16:46,On August 14 1941 Franklin Roosevelt together with Winston Churchill released a joint declaration which was to go under the name of the *Atlantic Charter*. For this question the sixth clause is the most important one: After the final destruction of Nazi tyranny they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.‚Äù   This charter alongside its sixth clause had a tremendous effect in the world and while Winston Churchill was quick to reassure his government that the charter did not apply to the British Empire Roosevelt had meant for it to apply universally. FDR had entered the 1940s with a strong anti-colonialist conviction. This of course extended to the belief that France should give up French Indochina (modern day Vietnam Cambodia and Laos). FDR felt very strongly about the possibility that Indochina had been used by the Japanese as a springboard for the initial conquests in 1942 (it wasn't) and adding onto his generally bleak opinion about the French after its defeat in 1940 made him very determined to speak out against French colonialism in Indochina.  This does not mean that Roosevelt saw Indochina was being prepared for independence. Roosevelt had at occasions displayed in the words of Fredrik Logevall a patronizing and cryptoracist view of the Vietnamese and considered them unfit to rule themselves. Instead he suggested a more paternalistic suggestion in which a *trusteeship* would be established along the lines of the mandate system of the League of Nations. These former colonies would be helped to independence through a series of stages culminating in total independence.  Roosevelt was very reluctant in allow Free French regular forces to return to Indochina and while he began to look the other way as Free French forces were deployed with the help from the British towards the end of his own life (and the war) Roosevelt still remained convinced that allowing France to return to Indochina was a bad idea - even though it began to falter due to the realities of the war itself. To Roosevelt the final (and inevitable) goal was universal decolonization.
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:11,&gt  had no intention of ending the war before a land invasion could take place just seems to ignore this basic reality.  That's not what I'm saying. The American leadership was happy that the bombs (in combination with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria -- the degree to which each of these put pressure on the Japanese leadership to surrender is a lively debate) were a factor in forcing the Japanese to surrender.   What I'm saying is that a common justification for the atomic bombings which was only promulgated after the war is that the bombs were used specifically by the American leadership to force Japan to surrender *instead of* a land invasion.   The argument usually runs something like well we killed a lot of civilians but it avoided (x million) American and Japanese casualties.   The issue I take with that is threefold:   1) the atomic bombings understood in the context of the war were a continuation of a deliberate policy of destroying Japanese (and German) cities with the attendant understanding that fire bombings would cost hundreds of thousands of civilian lives. So the idea that the atomic bombings and the casualties that resulted from them were somehow a unique event is wrong.   2) The targets for the bombs were selected and the bombs themselves were dropped without really much if any oversight or reference to Truman or anyone else in his cabinet.   We have this post-facto idea that the top leadership agonized over the decision and reluctantly decided that the cost to civilians was outweighed by the rapidity of ending the war. As I said (quoting /u/restricteddata) in my earlier post Truman didn't make any such decision. He was fairly shocked by the use of the bombs and placed a moratorium on their future use after the Nagasaki bombing which further implies that he didn't fully understand their use or intended effect.   3) At the time the bombs were dropped plans for a land invasion of Japan were in full force -- the exigencies of the military situation and the time it would have taken to plan for an invasion meant that it had to be running at full speed when the bomb was dropped. Which further contravenes the idea that we held off on a land invasion and waited for the bombs to work. 
YxxzzY,history,2015-03-10 17:15,Most know that they didn't have any choice. Especially when Hitler made almost all male persons that were able to hold and shoot a gun go to war.     People don't generally like to talk about the war itself here they talk about the regime there are no war-heroes like you might have in the US or any other allied nation.   Even tho my Grandfathers uncle was an ace no one ever told me until I started googling my surname  and asked a few questions. I think that is pretty cool but my parents and especially my grandparents  all of them born after the war think it's part of a bad and scary past they would rather forget about.  Just some unorganized thoughts  ). 
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:44,An excellent suggestion is Fredrik Logevall's *Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam* which covers the French Indochina War and early American involvement in Vietnam. It touches upon the US perspective quite often and how the US went from being against allowing the French to return under Roosevelt to complete support under Truman and Eisenhower.
DeadWeaselRoad,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:09,I took a Russian history course in last spring and my professor explained that Stalin did not have a real plan as far as what countries would come under the USSR's control but rather however far the Red Army would get would become part of the Soviet Union.   I can't speak to the Soviet leaders after him without being speculative so I won't.   This article might help you a bit.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/ir2/sovietexpansionineasterneuroperev1.shtml
International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:18,&gt  You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines?  To be clear my area of knowledge tends to be the Soviet economy as a whole rather than the specifics of logistical supply during the war. So the idea that any munitions crisis was the product of supply/transportation difficulties is pure conjecture. It may just be that the volumes produced while impressive simply weren't enough to cope with the intensity of the fighting. What I can say with confidence that Soviet armaments and munition production increased each year during the war and continually outstripped Germany. To quote from Adam Tooze's *Wages of Destruction*:  &gt  If there was a true 'armaments miracle' in 1942 it occurred not in Germany but in the armaments factories in the Urals. Despite having suffered territorial losses and disruption that resulted in a 25 per cent fall in total national product the Soviet Union in 1942 managed to out-produce Germany in virtually every category of weapons. The margin for small arms and artillery was 3:1. For tanks it was a staggering 4:1 a differential compounded by the superior quality of the T34 tank. Even in combat aircraft the margin was 2:1. It was this industrial superiority contrary to every expectation that allowed the Red Army first to absorb the Wehrmacht's second great onslaught and then in November 1942 to launch a whole series of devastating counterattacks.  But this is 1942. What is more accurate is to note is that in the 'darkest days' of the second half of 1941 there was an immense demand for munitions at precisely the time that production and transport were undergoing severe strain/dislocation. This was the period in which shortages of arms would have been greatest - as entire armies were lost and the economic mobilisation was still underway. From 1942 onwards (perhaps excluding Q1) however with the war economy established the problem became the opposite - how to avoid crashing the economy through excessive mobilisation.  &gt  Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals?  Not quite. The USSR was split into a six agricultural producer/consumer regions three of each. Much of the Southern Producer Region (ie the Ukraine) was lost to the Germans along with a chunk of the Central Producer Region (which included the Volga area). But the Eastern Producer Region (Siberia and most of Central Asia) was unoccupied and continued to produce. However these areas were not as naturally productive as those lands in European Russia and comprised maybe 25% of overall grain production (based on some very rough maths by me drawing on Davies' *Years of Hunger*).  That said the agricultural situation was severe. Granted the Germans had 'relieved' Moscow of about a third of its population during their advance but they'd also (deliberately) seized the prime grain producing areas. In 1942 agricultural output was a mere 40% of the pre-war level. This continued to be a severe strain on the Soviet population and economy until a recovery of sorts in 1944-45.  &gt  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  Which is a topic that I won't go into much. What I will say is that while industrialisation was an objective shared by all Bolsheviks the Stalinist form that it ultimately took during the 1930s was incredibly wasteful. I'd also question why the Soviets needed to effectively rebuild their army from scratch in 1941 - Stalin's purging and flawed pre-war deployments much surely take much of the blame for the catastrophe of Barbarossa.
Cruentum,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:11,I never said it was. I think it was from June 22nd to July 3rd or 4th (when Stalin made his own speech to the Soviet Union which he never did before then).           Again the mental breakdown legend comes from Chakovsky (who wasn't there) and Khrushchev (who was there). Molotov (who was there) said he didn't do it as a mental breakdown but to sort things out and had left with Malenkov while keeping in contact. So yeah it does sound like he wasn't losing it as much as Khrushchev proclaimed. 
MisterBigStuf,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:52,Churchill you can't be serious?
JesuIsEveryNameTaken,history,2015-03-10 20:14,How was Churchill able to rebound politically years later after such a catastrophe? 
Gettodacchopper,history,2015-03-10 21:38,The short version is that he warned about Hitler and Germany when few wanted to think about it. 
adave4allreasons,history,2015-03-10 22:17,One of the most ill-conceived plans ever.  Just like Churchill's Italian campaign.  Apparently he never understood that mountains make a difference in battle.  
macros-the-black,history,2015-03-10 23:37,Churchill had a few howlers. But his successes were more numerous. And he was old money.   It's interesting to compare this to modern politics where one mistake can cost a politician their career because of the availability of information through myriad media channels.   Churchill got away some serious missteps in judgement and went on to become what many would consider a 'great leader'. Wonder how many 'great leaders' we've missed out on because of the unforgiving nature of modern politics. 
TheChosenOne127,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 23:47,Actually Hitler was convinced that the landings was happening at Calais. It's the main reason that some panzer divisions were not in Normandy at the time of D-Day. The operation was referred to as Operation Fortitude. Things could've gone a lot worse during D-Day.
THIS_IS_SO_HILARIOUS,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 4:48,I would be very careful to use Khrushchev for source on Stalin it been known that Khrushchev is known for distorting and lying on Stalin's activity. He was a victim of the Ukraine famine himself and did sought to destroy any reputation on Stalin even with lying.
This_Is_The_End,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:20,I didn't knew that. I believed the relationship was solely influenced by the support for mercenaries and Poland in the Polish-Sovjet war.  At least all this together gives a nice hint why Stalin made his movements. 
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:29,Perhaps I should have been more concrete: What i meant to say is that he saw Indochina as the springboard for *every* major loss and campaign during the initial Japanese conquest. This also includes the Philippines which clearly had a very urgent relevance for Roosevelt. 
ShootingPains,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 7:58,I recall that Beevor talks about an all woman anti-tank regiment in his Stalingrad book. 
cosmitz,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 8:06,is my memory failing or did the british use the Churchill hvac there? 
eadingas,history,2015-03-11 8:29,His entire political career is a series of controversies gaffes and misjudgements. He languished on the back benches for almost a decade. If it wasn't for the WWII he'd have likely been remembered as at best an average politician  at worst - a monster (he sanctioned the use of gas on the Kurds machine guns on striking workers and expressed a desire to brutally crush Indian independence movement among other things). But his tenacity verging on cruelty proved to be just the thing needed in a world war.    Also in the general carnage and mess that was WWI British people simply didn't pay as much attention to individual actions - and Gallipolli was relatively minor loss for the British forces. Maybe if Churchill was responsible for something like the Somme he'd never bounce back again.
Georgy_K_Zhukov,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:00,Yeah as the Germans approached Stalingrad Soviet forces in the region were sparse so they threw just about anything with a pulse at them to delay it. '*Narodnoe Opolcheniye*' or citizen levies were utilized and saw workers from the Barrikady Ordnance Factory the Red October Steel Works and the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory thrown at the Germans with little real training and very underarmed.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:06,The timeline you mentioned is somewhat off but the story itself is true. Hitler saw the prototype on November 26. 1943. He asked if the plane could be fitted with bombs. When the company answered yes Hitler agreed on the production if the design was turned into a Blitzbomber.  Numerous people within the Luftwaffe disagreed and tried to persuade Hitler to use the plane as a fighter but it took until early 1945 until the Me 262 was used in the role it had been designed for. And while it was very dangerous as an interceptor there were too few to have a real impact on the war. The main advantages were the high speed which allowed the Me 262 to outrun escort fighters and the heavy armament.  Why did Hitler act this way? First Hitler in 1944 was not a very stable person. The strain of commanding the german army for years had taken its toll and he was abusing a lot of medical products. According the statements by people in his vicinity he was prone to fits of rage and depression and was very capable of acting irrational. Many people have classified him as clinically insane by this point.   While the actual motivations will remain unknown german-language sources claim that Hitler had a large desire for revenge against the western Allies. He hoped that the Me 262 would be able to bomb England and the allied forces with impunity - even though the payload was low and the design was not optimised for bombing runs.
jonewer,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:21,&gt  Are the likes of John Laffin Denis Winter Alan Clark and Liddell Hart really the entire reason for the emergence of that perspective?  Haig's descent from national hero *sans pareil* to comic book super-villain is something that I have been causally looking at recently hence my recent [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ynojf/when_did_the_war_poets_like_sassoon_and_owen/) on this sub about war poets.  So after the war he was much feted with some even fearing he might turn to politics and become a Mussolini type figure.   After his death we the publication of Lloyd-George's memoirs in the 1930's which is also when people like Edmonds and Liddell-Hart start cooking up mischief. Also of published at the time is Baker-Carr's book from which the (in)famous alleged quote about Haig and machine guns is to be mined. Nevertheless Haig's reputation holds up reasonably well in the 30's.  However it's really in the 1960's where things turn bad what with the publication of books by Clarke and Taylor while 'Oh what a Lovely War' achieves considerable popularity. There are some indication that Wilfred Owen's poetry becomes very popular at around this time.  It's maybe of note that the change in how Haig and the war was viewed coincided with the loss of large chunks of the Empire as well as with the general 1960's liberal consensus.  By the time Blackadder goes forth is broadcast in 1989 many school children's only exposure to the Great War is reading Owen's poetry in English classes with History classes picking up at Versailles through to Munich...  In 1998 (80 years after Victory) the Daily Express had a headline calling for Haig's statue to be removed with Clarke advocating it be vandalised as Haig was a mass murderer.  &gt  I recognize that the ‚ÄòButcher‚Äô Haig angle is very much on the decline right now but I still run into more moderate versions of it regularly  For the most part the 'rehabilitationist' view of Haig is confined to those who can actually be bothered to read a history book ie. a very small section of the population.  For the most part people's reactions to Haig are very much along the lines of Donkey through War Criminal to Mass Murderer and its hard to engage with such an ingrained concept in people who frankly aren't very interested in the first place.   
throwthetrash15,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:35,I like the answer. And I also understand that he indeed wanted a jet powered bomber that speed past allied fighters and bomb London- eventually New York- but what I don't understand is given the Me262's track record when it first was tested in actual combat he didn't actually bring to a reasonable production level. From my understanding he believed that repelling Overlord would mean a catastrophic loss for the Allies. This would allow him to focus in the East and potentially win the war. In the book D-Day Ambrose states that the Allies needed Air SUPREMACY (which they had at a great cost) over France to succeed with D-Day Hitler knew this as well. Why did he not see that a Jet fighter at this point could potentially challenge and quickly bring the superiority to him?
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:49,The Me 262 was barely ready for frontline service in summer 1944. Even if Hitler had decided to use the Me 262 as a fighter it would not have been avaiable in large enough numbers to change the outcome of the war.   You should also consider that Germany did not have the resources or the manpower to keep building the proven piston-engined fighters and set up a completely new production for jet fighters. The numerical superiority of allied fighters was simply too large.  And - last but not least - pilots had to be trained for the new plane. A jet fighter behaves very differently to a piston-engined fighter and Germany did not have a surplus of trained pilots quite to the contrary.
sk_2013,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:54,I'm pretty sure he means the AVRE unless Churchill had a secret weapon centering around central air.
norhis,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 10:09,According to Grunnbok i Norges Historie page 292-293 you are correct. Quisling was the leader of a party called National Assembly Nasjonal Samling in Norwegian. On the 9th of April he proclaimed himself as the new prime minister of a government who was willing to co-operate with the Reich. The Norweigan Supreme Court did not like Quisling much. On the 15th of April they voted to assemble an Administrative Councel. On April 24 Hitler made Josef Terboven Reichkommisar. The Germans wanted to distance themselfs from Quisling in order to establish a connection with the legitimate Norwegian government instances. This was mostly so they with the cooperation of the Parliament could establish a government and work against the Norwegian Government in London.   Sources:   Helle et al. 2013.

kieslowskifan,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 11:08,The story of the Me-262's use as a bomber is somewhat convoluted and exaggerated in postwar memoirists such as Adolf Galland. In February 1943 a *F√ºhrerbefehl* decreed that all fighter aircraft should provision for bomb racks so they could be used as fighter-bombers. Willy Messerschmitt then incorporated the provision for bomb racks into the design and began development on paper for pure bomber variants of the 262.  In September 1943 Messerschmitt personally assured Hitler that the 262 could be used as a high-speed bomber over southern England.  When Hitler saw a 262 on display he inquired whether it could carry bombs and Messerschmitt again affirmed that the 262 could carry a decent bomb load. From all this Hitler got the impression that the 262 was analogous to the Ar234 a bomber that would use speed to evade enemy defenses. By January 1944 at a conference with Milch and Speer Hitler stressed that the bomb load of the 262 should be increased so when a *Jagerstab* conference on aircraft production the following May noted that the 262 was to be a fighter Hitler thought his orders were being deliberately flaunted. Milch tried to argue the case for the 262 as a fighter but Hitler would have none of it. Goering subsequently sent out a directive stating The F√ºhrer has ordered that the Me 262 is to be operated purely as a high-speed bomber. There is to be no mention of it as a fighter until further notice.   So what impact did this have on the deployment of the 262? Not very much. The bomber variants of the 262 were already in development long before the May 1944 *Jagerstab* conference. The 262 program like many high-technology programs was beset by technical issues which were compounded by Germany's shortages of strategic materials.  The greatest problem for the 262 was what made it so revolutionary: its engines. The Junkers Jumo 004 selected for the 262 after its intended powerplant the  BMW 003 fell hopelessly behind schedule was a persnickety design and ersatz materials gave it a very short design life. The bugs within the engine were difficult to iron out and prevented any full-scale deployment of the 262 in early 1944.  Furthermore a shortage of trained workers and the pressures of dispersal of factories caused by Allied bombing put a ceiling on how many 262s could be produced.   The 262 as bomber entered into postwar memory as an example of Hitler's strategic myopia. Postwar Luftwaffe veterans would argue that but for the  F√ºhrer the 262 could have entered into production earlier and turned the tide of the air war. Writers such as Ambrose uncritically repeated this  line was but the reality was the 262 arguably went into service as early as it could have given the circumstances. Luftwaffe pilots also had great difficulty coming up with new tactics and formations which to use the 262 effectively. The convoluted nature of the 262's bomber interlude does indict the Third Reich on a different set of charges. The polycratic nature of the Third Reich where there were multiple centers of power all dependent upon Hitler's approval meant that German officials were inclined to try and court the F√ºhrer's opinion. Messerschmitt like many other technical experts in the aviation industry often misled or exaggerated aviation developments to suit Hitler's expectations. In the example of the 262 Willy Messerschmitt conflated paper projects for a pure 262 bomber with the emerging new design which just had bomb racks.   *Sources*  Boyne Walter J. *Messerschmitt Me 262: Arrow to the Future*.

twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:31,Margaret Thatcher for US President Winston Churchill for UK PM Ghengis Khan for Russian President All at the same time in present day.  I love my Brits and my Comrades in the motherland but a nice fat world war between those two and a somewhat rational and sane US president would sure make someone else the asshole for the next 50 years. And thats kinda what I want for the US. For us to stop being the asshole. 
twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:35,The man was a drunk and definitely racist. He was a unyielding demonstration of the power of will. Winston Churchill is everything that was needed and his entire fate embodied. He **HAD** to be a stubborn iron willed bulldog. Its who he was made to be.    Not every person the world over will celebrate who he was but their lives have been impacted by his existence. 
joefurry,history,2015-03-11 11:41,In terms of 'human history' I would say Stalingrad.   It had the most combatants and was the bloodiest battle of all time in absolute terms.  If the German's had won then it would have likely been all over for Russia. Germany would be able to take the oil in the Caucasus region and refocus efforts on taking Moscow.   As it was the Germans lost 1 million men and had no further strategic victories in the East.   Maybe the Western Allies would have beaten Germany but if Russia had fallen the war would probably seen a much heavier genocide and the Western Allies losses would have been much much higher. It's possible that they wouldn't have been able to win and the USA would have sued for peace rather than unconditional surrender.   This scenario is all laid out in the horrifying novel Fatherland by Robert Harris. 
BFGDoomer,history,2015-03-11 12:26,Stalingrad is a great choice. Very horrible battle too.
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 12:42,Don't be so certain that things would have gone that different. Roosevelt's thinking was in the face of reality just wishful thinking and while he kept pushing for it there was nothing stopping the French from returning to claim their colony once more in 1945.  FDR saw colonialism in pre-WWI as one of the reasons for that very war and he was also horrified by the treatment of the colonized population under the colonizers. This was also one of the reasons to why he was against the French from returning seeing their treatment of the Vietnamese as something negative.
