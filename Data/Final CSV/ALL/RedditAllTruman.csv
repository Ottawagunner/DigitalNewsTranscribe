trumang,futurebeatproducers,2015-03-17 13:13,https://soundcloud.com/trumang-1/headstand  Made this beat for rapping/singing over but I don't feel like it has enough variation. Any ideas on how to help?
Davidmossman,serialpodcast,2015-03-17 13:50,OP got Truman showed!  It was worth it to see the look on his face when a few people didn't know what he was talking about!  We did it guys!
Gabmaia,EliteDangerous,2015-03-17 14:04,As handy as this is  I wish they fixed it soon. For me the Truman Conundrum is the biggest issue in the game right now

impinchingurhead,space,2015-03-17 14:26,"You do not read very well. I said IN MY LIFETIME. That includes Truman  Eisenhower  Kennedy  Johnson  Nixon  Ford  Carter  and then Reagan and everyone that followed.  I also said  exterminated the concept of civilians entering government FOR PUBLIC SERVICE. There is no shortage of applications for government employment. There is just an absence of applicants whose motivation is public service. Your statement that public service is just PC jargon just illustrates your own moral bankruptcy. It was a cultural value prior to Reagan.  Eisenhower referred to the military industrial congressional complex and later deleted the word ""congressional"" for political reasons. His was not a distrust of government. He distrusted the consolidation of congressional and corporate power and its potential to make armed conflict the tool of choice in resolving all international disputes.  I might add that all republican presidents since Reagan have attempted to solidify the Military Industrial Complex model."
Onewomanslife,todayilearned,2015-03-17 15:16,"Too many  that is for sure. The sad thing is  though  that the kids who have been failed often grow up to repeat that cycle and fail others.  I like what Truman said "" The BUCK stops here."""
subherbpat,Frisson,2015-03-17 15:28,This is on exhibit at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence  Missouri.  It was found in Mr. Truman’s desk at his Missouri Home after his death in 1972  almost 20 years after he left office.  “Mr. Truman    As you have been directly responsible for the loss of our son’s life in Korea  you might just as well keep this emblem on display in your trophy room  as a memory of one of your historic deeds. Our major regret at this time is that your daughter was not there to receive the same treatment as our son received in Korea.  Signed    William Banning”

Arebos,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:14,One of the main reasons I can think of would be his relief of General Douglas MacArthur.  MacArthur was a very popular general and national hero during WWII who helped turn the battle in the pacific around after being pushed out of the Philippians.  He was also a distinguished soldier and leader during WWI.  He was even considered a political candidate during the 1940's elections.    However  during the push back against the North Korean invasion  MacArthur went against express orders in several respects and invaded the North  thus instigating Chinese involvement.   Truman removed MacArthur from command in Korea thus receiving a huge political backlash of public support for the decision. He decided not to even run for reelection.   Casey  Steven (2008).

stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill  Roosevelt  Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
cvillemade,news,2015-03-17 17:36,Really?   Have you ever heard of President Truman?
schlahdeedah,weddingplanning,2015-03-17 17:38,"No not tybee. Surprisingly never been a big tybee person! I grew up on Skidaway in the Landings so thats where the wedding and all pictures minus first looks will take place. It takes roughly 30 mins from the cathedral  and now that our exit on Truman isnt the last exit anymore the traffic has been practically non-existent.  We are all staying directly on Bay/River St so getting downstairs and  back up wont be an issue. Then the plan is to pick a road and walk till we hit the cathedral  taking pics along the way. Then jump in a car and go from the cathedral to the island.   I went to school at SVA  so did our photographer  so we have no only made that walk hundreds of times but we also kinda have a rough idea of where those ""pictures along the way"" should be.   I rambled. Im sorry. Savannah natives make me excited. Its nice for someone to have an idea of what im talking about. "
siq1ne,Guildwars2,2015-03-17 17:49,This happens because part of the map (they don't want you to see) is probably unfinished or you're at the edge of the map so nothing exists but wallpaper. It's like that movie Truman. xD  With the gliding aspect of HoT  the new places will probably have little of this (yay!) but you can't glide out of Maguuma Wastes so there is no likelihood of a change any time soon. 
Lugos,booksuggestions,2015-03-17 18:37,[In Cold Blood](http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Blood-Truman-Capote/dp/0679745580/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp qid=1426631826&amp sr=8-1&amp keywords=in+cold+blood) by Truman Capote is non-fiction  but parts are written in a fiction-esque manner based on interviews with both witnesses and the murderers themselves to flush out some detail. It gets into the mindset of the murders  why they did it  what kind of people they were  etc. and is considered a classic.  I hope that helps.
beatles-in-space,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 19:00,"President Truman had an ambitious domestic agenda  which he called the ""Fair Deal""  which stalled in front of a Republican-controlled Congress. In the 1948 campaign  he ran against the ""do-nothing Congress""  which turned out to be a successful political strategy  although it didn't improve his legislative prospects. An image of ineffectual leadership is never good.  He also had an ambitious foreign policy agenda which was much more successful. This included the UN Charter  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Berlin Airlift  Truman Doctrine  Marshall Plan  North Atlantic Treaty  and the Korean War. You have to remember that isolationist sentiment was still very strong in the United States. Truman's presidency was crucial because he kept the United States intimately involved in international relations in the post-World War II period. But a substantial faction of Republicans was opposed to some or all of these policies. In particular  the Korean War was carried out without a declaration of war and under the auspices of enforcing the UN Charter  under UN auspices and with the authority of a UN Security Council resolution. Imagine what that must have meant to a country which 30 years earlier had rejected the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations! And furthermore  the war turned into a stalemate  in which tens of thousands of American troops were killed. Dwight Eisenhower came into office largely on the back of this issue  and the idea that Truman was overextending the country. His corrective was to reign in the Korean War-era defense budget and put much more emphasis on nuclear deterrence  creating the Cold War as we know it. It was a sort of ""return to normalcy"" (to quote Warren Harding) that the American people were looking for. Eisenhower normalized the Cold War and had a simultaneously more unilateral and more restrained foreign policy."

disastermaster254,funny,2015-03-17 19:22,I think the sacrifice one is A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote
Cromulent-Username,TheSimpsons,2015-03-17 19:24,To make good on this drunken boast  Truman authorised the onetime printing of the largest denomination currency ever - a trillion dollar bill.
Gayburn_Wright,Frisson,2015-03-17 19:32,Reminds me of the episode of M.A.S.H I watched today. Wherein Hawkeye goes crazy from exhaustion and sends a telegram to Truman asking him who was responsible for the war.

kingofeggsandwiches,todayilearned,2015-03-17 10:08,"You mean like when Truman fucked the British and Canadians out of their own research? The research they'd sent their best scientists to work on and provided the research basis for by ""losing"" the document Roosevelt had signed before he died agreeing to share whatever progress the Manhattan project made in return for all the the prior research the British and Canadians had made designing nuclear weapons and the assistance of the scientists assigned to those projects?

MotorboatingSofaB,newjersey,2015-03-17 10:29,Ithaca (Finger Lakes)  My wife and I have gone up every year for the past 5 years.  We tend to go in the summer or fall since Winter could be pretty harsh up there.  I see you're going in a few weeks which should be OK but certainly not swimming weather.  Ithaca itself is a pretty small town but with some wonderful restaurants.  Really we go for the wineries.  There are over 100 wineries in the Finger Lakes region with the bulk of them on Cayuga and Seneca lake.  When we go we like to stay on the west of Cayuga near Trumansberg since that is right smack in the middle of wineries while still being close to Ithaca.  Beyond drinking wine there are loads of amazing hiking trails around the gorges and plenty of local swimming holes under waterfalls (again more for the summer)  You won't find too many hotels up there so I would recommend using AirBnB to find a room or house for rent.  You'd be going during the off-season so you should be able to find some pretty good deals.  $300 might be tough since the lodging would cost that much but the good thing about the wineries is that tasting are at MAX $5 with some being free.  There are also breweries (my personal favorite - Ithaca Brewery) and distilleries that are opening.  If you do end up going go to Stone Cat cafe of the east side of Seneca lake.  True farm-to-table restaurant that is outstanding.  I could go on and on so let me know if you want more recommendations.
dsprox,conspiracy,2015-03-17 10:54,"&gt I'm looking at it like what it is.  No you're not that's absolutely 100% wrong and proved wrong by basics ballistics trajectory analysis.  He was shot from the sewer storm drain at the bottom of the grassy knoll.  You can literally draw a line from that point to his head at the exact angle the bullet was fired from because that's how it happened which is why it causes his head to go back UP and to the technical right if you are viewing from the perspective of the shooter back and to the left from the view behind Kennedy.  Bill Cooper had access to a lot of information but because of that I feel it was grouped with a lot of disinformation to keep him from being able to properly ""spill the beans"".  Nobody is going to listen to what you have to say about the NSA in 1991 when what you say is literally this:  &gt  President Truman created the supersecret National Security Agency (NSA) by secret Executive order on November 4 1952. Its primary purpose was to decipher the alien communications language and establish a dialogue with the extraterrestrials.  &gt This most urgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort.  &gt The secondary purpose of the NSA was to monitor all communications and emissions from any and all electronic devices worldwide for the purpose of gathering intelligence both human and alien and to contain the secret of the alien presence.  ""What? Aliens? Yeah sure this guy's crazy. All that NSA stuff must be wrong too since this nut job is saying its' because of aliens.""  This is why I feel that the government uses aliens as propaganda for social control in many various forms one of which is to keep dissenters marginalized much like Bill Cooper was."
