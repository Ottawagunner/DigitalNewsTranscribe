pasunthrowaway,france,2015-03-17 14:47,Sans la Seconde Guerre Mondiale  l'armée Soviétique c'est toujours une incapable qui à eu des problèmes face à la Finlande. Faut se redresser des purges d'abord.  Le Japon aurait-il choisi d'attaquer les US si les Soviétiques étaient pris dans une guerre générale à l'Ouest ?   Aussi  si les démocraties voient l'URSS comme un menace beaucoup plus tôt  ils risquent de laisser le Japon faire ce qu'il veut parce que ça fait un allié de revers. Ou si il y a une guerre quand même  soutenir les Nationalistes.   Et si les Russes attaquent  ils ont absolument toute l'Europe contre eux (même Mussolini et Franco seraient content d'aller tuer du bolchevique). Sans aucun allié. Et que si c'est dur d'envahir la Russie  pour la Russie envahir l'Europe demande une logistique et je suis pas sur qu'ils l'aient.  Leur seule fenêtre c'est quand les Occidentaux sont occupés avec l'Allemagne  ils peuvent prendre des bouts. Et encore  peut être qu'en 40 les Allemands auraient accepté de se rendre à l'Ouest pour aller se battre à l'Est comme certains voulaient faire en 44.
ManicMarine,badpolitics,2015-03-17 15:09,Wait  you think that there's a clear theory behind fascism? Defining exactly what fascism is is a hugely contentious issue among historians. The fact that Mussolini was an opportunist doesn't help matters.
yogasquare,OkCupid,2015-03-17 15:35,"1. Your first paragraph is mostly cliches. That first section is your only chance to catch my attention before I get bored and leave. Telling me that you're a hopeless romantic with your head in the clouds isn't exciting.   2. Your spiel about knowing what you want immediately when it comes to dating  and how that can scare people  is a big red flag. It says ""stage 5 clinger who is going to propose on the first date.""  3. Talking about Oxford commas is worn out. You especially shouldn't discuss them  since you appear not to know what they are. (For the record  an Oxford comma is the last comma in a series of three or more items: Hitler  Mussolini--*** ***-- and Hirohito.)"
xerdopwerko,politics,2015-03-17 15:40,"The original version of the PRI  after the revolution  was socialist leaning.   After the ""Mexican Miracle"" of the 1950s  it leaned further and further right. Today  it is the model ""Neoliberal"" party. One of our former presidents is one of the architects of the IMF's current policies  Dr. Ernesto Zedillo.   The strongest opposition party is the PAN  founded by the Synarchists  which were Pro-Franco  Pro-Mussolini Catholic fascists from the 1930s. While it leaned towards a slightly more liberal ""Christian-Democracy"" policy  especially with Clouthier in the late 1980s and early 90s  the PAN is a borderline Neofascist Catholic Pro-Business party  with close ties to organised crime. The more conservative wings of PRI and PAN are closely woven together. It is said both parties are run by Carlos Salinas (president of Mexico from 1988-1994  heavily conservative neoliberal)  who was actually a member of both of them.  He  in fact  had the candidates of both parties  Clouthier for the PAN and Colosio for the PRI  killed within a few years  so that his successor Zedillo could take power.  Maybe you mean the PRD  which was  as of 2006  infiltrated by lots of PAN followers  called the ""Chuchos""  led by Jesús Zambrano.   Yes  the PRI still hold membership in the Socialist International  but that was earned by the 20th century PRI  right after the Mexican Revolution (hell  their model of land distribution was originally adopted by the Bolshevik revolutionaries themselves  in the 20s!).  I wish  completely and totally  that we had real Socialism in Mexico.  PRI and PAN  however  are closely in line to Business-side Republicans and Religious-side Republicans  respectively.   Do you live in Mexico?  "

billybones79,FellowKids,2015-03-17 17:26,Commissioning a painting  and doing it yourself is pretty different  and I'm sure it took a few generations for the Roman to accept that being vain was a-ok. The selfie as a medium of self-promotion/expression has only been around a decade or so  I'm certain that someone such as Mussolini  a deeply jingoistic  anti-liberal reactionary man  would view this new medium as a corruption of youth and a proof that the new generation is weak and soft.   Also I meant he yearn for the land glory of the roman empire  pretty sure he barely cared about the social aspect of it  certainly not the republic part.
8x7Penormous,videos,2015-03-17 17:40,It's a recruitment video for a group which is used to protest and intimidate  in Putin's name.  The group is also associated with skinheads. There are also allegations that members of Nashi beat up russian Journalist Kashin.  It's text book really. The Nazis and Mussolini did much the same thing. Of course  Nashi is more inspired by soviet times. Get the kids to report on their elders.  Today it's traffic violations. Tomorrow it's a journalist who published an annoying article.  In a working democracy  there should be no need for vigilante groups.

JFVarlet,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 18:35,Well  it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups  as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks  more the lower-middle officers  especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests  but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism  Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy  even though there's a King  Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan  on the other hand  there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor  so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations  which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.

frsp,badpolitics,2015-03-17 19:16,The best (in the context of fascism  I mean  not saying it's a good thing) theoretician of fascism outside of Mussolini would probably be Oswald Mosely.

freefrench,france,2015-03-17 19:56,"une invasion allemande par les plaines belges qui échoue devant le plan allié ""Dyle Breda"" c'est plusieurs mois/années de front à l'ouest (Belgique) avec blocus allié et guerre sous-marine allemande.

Kaccie,sweden,2015-03-17 9:17,&gt (vafan det nu betyder).   **Wiki [Neo-fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-fascism)**   Neo-fascism is a post–World War II ideology that includes significant elements of fascism. The term neo-fascist may apply to groups that express a specific admiration for Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler may also be called Neo-Nazis and Italian Fascism or any other fascist leader/state. Neo-fascism usually includes ultranationalism populism anti-immigration policies or where relevant nativism anti-communism anti-marxism and opposition to the parliamentary system and liberal democracy.    &gt Expos hela existens bygger på att motarbeta just SD   Nej det gör den inte.
For_Your_Krarma,FellowKids,2015-03-17 9:49,"This immediately came to mind. I'm surprised so many have written this off as fellowkid shit. The teacher obviously isn't looking for a simple yes or no. The students should be thinking about why selfie's are taken. The common people take them out of vanity. In the hands of politicians they can be propaganda. Would selfie's be permitted under a fascist regime? How does the mentality of the people living under Mussolini differ from the ""Me"" Generation? Would a selfie be effective propaganda for Mussolini to utilize?  My guess is OP blew it on this question. "
Abravadabra,worldnews,2015-03-17 10:27,"That's absolutely not true in France maybe that's a logic wich applies to the USA but not in France.  It's good storytelling and i see why redditor love it but it's far away from any truth.  The french revolution wasn't an ""every brake is broken"" moment. At first the revolutionary wanted to keep the king in place just with a limitation of power. It's because the king didn't respect his part of the deal several times he was executed. He was vetoing constantly bills voted by the parliament he tried to ally himself with other european monarchs against France. The royalty was not discarded at all and the French people still had a lot of respect for their king. Even after the betrayal of the king there was still a lot of debat in the parliament to see if they should kill the king or not.  The revolution was also preceeded by the ""Etats géneraux"" were all the population said what they had to say to the king.   Of course the revolution had its dark times but it was not as simplist as you make it sounds.  And you also forgot entirely that particularly in the 20th and now 21st century a lot of time it's conservatives who had extreme attemps to make the society as they wishes it was. Like hitler or mussolini. They were not only ""moderating the march of  pogress"". And if we take hitler point of view what he was doing was progress. Progress to a more conservative society.  You can make anything under the term progressive and conservative. If you are in a perfect equalitarian free democracy and someone wants to change it to more inequality and less liberty that is so called ""progressive"" who will surely be the conservative and will want to spot the modification of the society."
MaltyBeverage,worldnews,2015-03-17 10:36,Maybe by American standards. Fascism is big on government control and state benefits to those it likes. Mussolini was a leading socialist before he made the fascist and the nazis were the national socialist and before that hitler ran the workers party. Fascism is right due to nationalism imperialism militarism etc.   Putin is left of hitler but way to the right 
ZippityD,AskReddit,2015-03-17 10:45,Yeah this gets much more interesting! Thanks for the tip!  We got your racists:  &gt  Most indigenous races on this planet along with most of the middle east population are nothing but UN-evolved UN-educated savages and idiots held in the past by false gods and non-existent claims to things that do not exist.  Your anti-religion:  &gt  I believe religion should be treated like a mental illness. How religion can be viewed as healthy I don't know.  Your reflective Nazis: &gt  I'm not a national socialist and I dislike how Mussolini's Italy had started to concern itself with Jews and race near the end of WWII. However western civilization would have been far better off if the Axis won World War 2.[1]   If the men who fought in WWII could have seen the future of their countries most allied men would have changed sides to join the Axis and the Germans and Italians would have fought 10 times as fervently. Sorry Jews and non-whites. You guys just need to take one for the team.  Your self described INTJs: &gt  I am a lot smarter than 90% of the people that I socialize with.  And your straight assholes: &gt  Kanye West isn't that bad.
JDHoare,socialism,2015-03-17 10:56,"&gt Further how exactly can Fascism be derived from Communism?  They're correct to the extent that fascism - and national socialism - cherrypicked from earlier radical left creeds although not Communism specifically. Although they're more firmly rooted in the right it's this lingering influence that acts as a flimsy screed for Fox News commentators to claim Hitler was a socialist or Obama is a Nazi or whatever it is they're doing this week. (The truth just in case there's any doubt is that both fascism and national socialism are right wing political ideologies with some populist left-wing elements)  Mussolini's politics for example developed as a member of the Italian Socialist Party (where he edited papers like The Future of the Worker and Class Struggle) and the word ""fascism"" comes from Fascio - a bundle or sheath - which was a name applied to literally any political grouping in early 20th Century Italy.   His personal politics were rooted in the radical left - he was a republican and referred to priests as ""black germs."" World War I changed all that as it did for many leftists in mainland Europe.  &gt In addition Nazism isn't derived from Fascism it's a particular ""brand"" of fascism that developed in Germany in the 1930's  Nazism is a brand of lower-case fascism but it's fair to say that it's - much like say Peronism or Falangism - derived from Italian Fascism which is an ideology in itself."
