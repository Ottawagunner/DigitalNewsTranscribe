felix-de-valois,podemos,2015-03-17 17:03,Por que hacen el trabajo sucio a las grandes empresas reciben una buena remuneración a cambio  y manejan la mano de obra a su antojo. ¿Como es posible?    Es posible si cuentan con la anuencia de los Gobiernos de turno la laxitud de los indicatos  y las urgencias de los trabajadores.

RitaTome,news,2015-03-17 20:04,This is correct. If you are standing on a public space - street  sidewalk  whatever - you can photograph inside a private home as long as the lens is no greater than a 50mm  which is about what the normal human eye can see.  If someone is in their private home with the curtains open  they still have an expectation of privacy against telephoto lenses  binoculars  telescopes  etc. Source: am former photojournalist and our newspaper had good lawyers
bassmasta187,photography,2015-03-17 20:07,I used to run a rental shop from a photojournalism school. The AB's died every semester. Elinchrom's are built way better in my experience. And to be completely honest  speedlights and pocketwizards are going to go so much further than plug in strobes. With my speedlights I can make a studio if i need it  light an event on my camera and shoot anything in between with ease. 
beccaonice,AskReddit,2015-03-17 9:25,"I have been very passionate about photography since early high school and after doing a couple years of traditional college that didn't feel like it was going anywhere I decided to pursue a photography degree. I was about 20 when I made this decision.   I did very well in school and graduated with honors. I do genuinely believe I have a talent for photography that is not in everyone.  So towards the end of the degree program I started to try and get my career on track. I went in thinking I would do photojournalism but after speaking to a lot photographers and doing research I found that this path is very difficult to get into. Everyone was pushing event/wedding photography which is not what I wanted to do really but it is ""where the money is."" I got a few opportunities to do a few jobs for pay and I hated all of it. It was dull tedious work. And all my ""passion projects"" felt so cheapened by this dance for money/photo rights.   Basically what I discovered is I don't have the stomach for playing the business game I hate event work and I didn't have the financial stability to start my own business anyway. I got a full time office job (for eating and living reasons)  and I thought I would keep trying to build my photography on the side but the motivation left.  I miss when I just took photos and just freely shared them just for the love of it. I hate that the fear of having my images stolen of feeling like I am cheating other professional photographers by working for free the desire to be properly credited the feeling that I would be paid was all drilled into my head that I stopped even wanting to pick up my camera.

Nyuhtaim,podemos,2015-03-17 10:02,"Es alucinante el hecho de ver cómo los medios han anulado la capacidad de análisis de la realidad de mucha gente. Media mass dinámicas estresantes alimentos con cargas neurotóxicas...qué duda cabe que quien ha diseñado esto lo ha hecho cara lograr un claro propósito...Quienes hemos ""despertado"" por así decirlo o más bien quienes conservamos el sentido común vemos todo esto claro...Otros no e intento comprender por qué algo tan evidente no son capaces de verlo. Se han acostumbrado a tragar con todo lo que los medios le ponen en la mesa. Tragan con toda clase de trampantojos...y como le intentes decir que eso es un trampantojo o sea un bacalao con forma de chocolate y no chocolate te van al cuello.  Como dato positivo me quedo con el hecho de saber que gente que daba por imposible al final no sé cómo acabó viendo la luz...  pero sí...alucinante la influencia que ejercen los media mass sobre algunas personas."
