VeritatisOculare,exmormon,2015-03-17 12:12,I've studied WW2 for a long time. I'm very familiar with what Germany was like during the rise of Hitler and the nuances of Nazism. But the SWASTIKA ISN'T NUANCED ANY MORE. 
anime_wars,AskScienceFiction,2015-03-17 12:15,Things like personality  passions  interests  etc aren't passed on to a clone. People who have had pets and animals cloned are specifically warned by scientists that the new pet will not be like the old pet  and the results bear this out.  I also recall that sometimes physical features are not 100% reproducible  though I am unsure of exactly where this originates. So I am stumped on physical attributes portion of this question  and personally I think he probably isn't actually a clone of Hitler.

funky_shmoo,worldnews,2015-03-17 12:16,RT correspondent on Ukrainian Government: Nazi. Nazi. Nazi. Nazi. Nazi. Nazi... Hitler!! &lt intense stare&gt   I'm sure that bad things are happening on both sides in this conflict. Armed conflicts have a funny habit of doing that. There's no way to spin the annexation of Crimea as anything but Russian aggression  and that's where this story largely begins. I don't trust RT to have an iota of independence discussing anything remotely related to this conflict  or the Ukrainian government in general. I seriously doubt many people outside of Russia do either.

Evil_white_oppressor,european,2015-03-17 12:20,I'm going to go a step further and say that it's not because of Hitler  it's because the Soviet Union won the war.  WWII was a war of nationalist vs. communist ideals  and communist ideals won the war  even when most Americans and British people had no idea.  Because of the Soviet victory  it eventually led to equal rights movement  and everything else went downhill from there.  
lanyardspaniard,Atlanta,2015-03-17 12:20,Oh no - it's not just liberals who think politicians issue empty promises  but it's only liberals who JUSTIFY another liberal's lies. Obama can be equal to Hitler but....DID YOU KNOW HE KNOWS JAY-Z?!?!?!?

If you like them so much  move there!""    It's totally stupid. Especially if so many people's lives are at stake.   If all the others are that bad and hitlerish  why do our politicians even bother to lie to us? The answer is: Because they and therefore we do not have the morale high ground - not in the slightest.   Because IF we knew the real reasons for our governments' actions and actually knew everything they're doing  we would absolutely not consent."

hopeful_nihilist,explainlikeimfive,2015-03-17 13:10,Well that is the justification. But  I don't think its really true. The UK isn't overrun with dictators. None of the currently parliaments that dominate the democratic world seem any more risk for tyranny than the rare Presidential systems. Moreover  Germany  did have separation of powers  which didn't prevent Hitler's rise--so it's not clear they do anything anyone once a popular figure starts murdering the opposition. I see why the first large democratic republic  experimenting would want them. But historical  comparative political analysis doesn't really support the idea that they function the way they are intended.

TheHornyHobbit,harrypotter,2015-03-17 13:15,"Given the timing of Grindelwald's fall (1945) the connection with WW2 is heavily implied but I will expound on it a little.  Grindelwald was a Nazi Wizard.  Hitler was actually under the imperious curse the whole time.  Grindelwald was targeting all mudbloods during the Holocaust  he was just starting with minorities so as to not invoke a full on muggle rebellion.  Also those ""Nazi science experiments"" were mostly magical experiments."

YRM_DM,Christianity,2015-03-17 13:26,"Maybe we're just using different terms.  Religious freedom is a positive thing that makes progress possible.  When Religious freedom is not possible... either through things like atheist Stalin  or cult-like Hitler  or in the Salem Witch Trials  or in Sharia Law states today  or in the days of the Inquisition.   That is when progress suffers.  And I am 100% for religious freedom.  If someone ever tried to pass a law saying you couldn't go to church  pray with family and friends  worship in your home  etc.  I'd be right there with you protesting.  I may not think it's truth  but  you have every right to believe what you want.   We live in a great country where debate is possible.  What I'm trying to say is that  when strongly religious people get power and try to enforce their strictest morality in law... like  in Afghanistian where the Taliban were executing homosexuals in soccer stadiums.   Or during the dark ages...  or in Salem during the witch trials.  People are shut down.  Progress is halted.  It can be anyone shutting this down  as long as they are a fervent believer in whatever...   Kim Jong Il thinks he's a god  so he dominates all other religion out of his culture and promoted myth about himself.  Freedom &gt   non-freedom  It doesn't really matter what the belief systems are  within that freedom... as has been pointed out  when Islam was less radical  they were at the leading edge of technology and progress in the world.   It's not because Islam is ""true"" but because they allowed for more religious freedoms at that time."

YesPlzM8,pcmasterrace,2015-03-17 13:48,"Huh. Its nice to see schools teach about the Pacific Front. Here in my part of 'Murica  you can't learn anything other than ""Hitler was bad  M'kay? He killed a million-bajillion jews. He also started this thing called 'World War 2' but we're gonna focus more on Hitler cuz he's *Really* bad.""  As a WWII buff since 6th grade  it royally pissed me off to no end that we never talked about the god damn war itself. Especially since the Pacific was completely ignored except for Pearl Harbor."
DrHoppenheimer,askaconservative,2015-03-17 13:48,"They're a liberal democracy - the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. They are politically stable. They are allies and friends.  There was a partition plan following the second world war. The Mandate of Palestine was former Ottoman territory  administered by the British under a League of Nations mandate  and there was a proposal by the newly formed UN to partition the land into two states:  1. A Jewish state  consisting of majority-Jewish regions. 2. A Muslim state  consisting of majority-Muslim regions.  While the partition plan was never formally accepted (it was accepted by the international community at large and the local Jewish population  but was rejected by the Muslim population and the surrounding nations). But it was a reasonable and fair plan  and the proposed partition borders closely matched the borders of Israel when they declared their independence.  (let's also not forget that the Muslim Arab population  led by Grand Mufti Haj Amin Al-Husseini  President of the Supreme Muslim Council of Palestine  were allies of Hitler and the Nazi's in WW2. Al-Husseini was particularly fond of Hitler's ""Final Solution."")  But at the end of the day  Israel exists. Its people live there  and they have lived there their entire lives  as have their parents  and as will their children. Discussion about ""historical claim"" is irrelevant unless you support ethnic cleansing.  The ""multicultural state"" is a modern - and flawed - idea. The whole point of states is to create political borders at cultural and ethnic divides. There is an enormous body of research which shows that political borders decrease violence and create stability. Mismatch between culture and country creates unnecessary domestic political tension  shared cultures have shared values  which are embodied in local laws and government decisions. You only have to look at Africa to see how badly drawn borders can lead to decades of brutal internal conflict. And civil wars tend to be the nastiest wars of all.  That isn't to mean that countries shouldn't protect the civil and political rights of minorities. But countries should have a dominant culture  either through historical inheritance (old world) or the melting pot (new world).  The two state solution is the only viable solution that can secure a permanent peace."

Fredfredbug4,AskReddit,2015-03-17 13:56,[Heil Honey  I'm home!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9jJx0NSjw) was a British sitcom that aired for one episode. Hitler and Eva Braun live in an apartment  but have well meaning but obnoxious Jewish neighbors. Antics occur when they invite Neville Chamberlain for dinner.   The show was cancelled after the first episode  for obvious reasons. Perhaps it wasn't appropriate for prime time British TV  but I can see the show being very successful on late night American television.   If you're not willing to watch the full episode  the jokes were very hit or miss. Though I can't think of any TV show who's Pilot was absolutely perfect. The show had potential. The jokes aren't even overtly offensive  many times it's just history nerd humor and your cheesy sitcom gags.   [This was my favorite scene.](https://youtu.be/mf9jJx0NSjw?t=15m53s)

Trionout,flicks,2015-03-17 14:18,"**Bonnie and Clyde** *dir. Arthur Penn  1967*      *Bonnie and Cyde* couldn't have come in a better time. Even if the story is set in the 30's  the movie's countercultural spirit is undeniable. It has two anti-heroes who are tired of the monotony of life  and find a way of escaping in one another. In a way  Bonnie and Clyde are just two hippies.      Revolutionary in its editing that borrowed from the likes of Godard and Resnais  *Bonnie and Clyde* is different from pretty much everything that came out at the time. Penn's movie is violent  it features two anti-heroes and it's really fast-paced.      By the end of the day  however  the greatest achievement of *Bonnie and CLyde* is to make us feel fond of those characters  and understand their relationship and why they do what they do. It's like we are members of the Barrow Gang.       **5/5**      **Office Space** *dir. Mike Judge  1999*      Apparently  having a job and a normal life wasn't a good thing in the 90's. Especially in the year 1999  where not only this movie  but also *Fight Club* and *American Beauty* dealt with the same theme of insatisfaction.      This is a pretty fun comedy about the part of the white adult male in society. Judge's visual choices are also interesting  especially how he uses slow-motion for the dramatization of pretty dumb moments. The use of music is also great  especially the hip-hop.      Overall  really good movie. **4/5**      **Rat Race** *dir.Jerry Zucker*      I watched this with my father  he said it was the best comedy he's ever seen. I don't know if I'll take his other recommendations. But hey  the Hitler jokes were funny!      **1.5/5**      **Kingsman: The Secret Service** *dir. Matthew Vaugh*      My problems with *Kingsman* come mainly from Mark Millar. It's a fun action movie and it features good performances  but it comes a certain point where everything is so over that I just couldn't stop thinking that if I were 4 years younger  I would be enjoying it a lot more.      Vaughn is a talented guy. He knows how to direct action scenes  he has a visual style and he uses music very well. The best example I can think of is the so commented church scene  where I realy think Vaufghn let himself go and turned everything up to 11. WHile the scene is good  it's almost like Vaughn is fast-forwarding everything so that A) the scene seems more frenetic and B) we don't have to see so much gore onscreen (what would kill the comic effect). Even so  Vaughn is smart enough to turn violence into something funny by stylizing it (something Tarantino does very well too).      Somehow  all of Vaughn's directorial choices are made so that he can ""fix"" Millar's story for the screen.      With an irregular cast (Firth and Strong are excellent  Caine and Jackson are not)  and a pretty dull first act  *Kingsman* is far from the wonder that many people said it is. However  it's still a pretty funny movie with a great third act and some good moments.      **3.5/5**      **Sex  Lies and Videotape** *dir. Steven Soderbergh  1989*      SLaV is the kind of movie that I love the most. Soderbergh's film is a study on 4 characters with unusual relations one to another. Nothing really dramatic happens  we just keep diving into those people's minds and finding out more about them as the movie goes.      The responsible for the explosion of independent filmmaking  as well as for making the Sundance film fest the Nº1 Independent festival  SLaV is an impressive debut film by Soderbergh. Here are all of the techniques that would be constant in his career  like his amazing [use of colors](http://i.imgur.com/CLQ9agw.jpg) to his camera movements that reveal tons of information about the characters.      Soderbergh's voyeuristic direction is the best thing about the film. There are no sex scenes in the film  because sex would do nothing to those characters. The talks that James Spader's character has with the women he tapes are much more intimate than a carnal relation.      Spader  by the way  gives one of the best performances (if not the best) of his career. His character is clouded by mistery  and while that would naturally make him look a threatening  Spader is constanty showing vulnerability in his small gestures. This is even more impressive if you think that his posterior career would be filled with dominant characters.      Cutting to a black screen in some of the most pivotal scenes in the movie  Soderbergh shows how much he knows about cinematic craft  and how he knows how to manipulate his audience. And God  how will I miss being manipulated by him.      **5/5**"

hopeful_nihilist,explainlikeimfive,2015-03-17 14:39,Well  the only really long term large Republics to compare are US  UK  and France. France  is a historical shit show  I don't even what to begin debating why its Republics fall like dominoes. But  Republics were super rare  per WW2  so most of that violent upheaval you site is really a different animal  cough Monarchy or Monarchy conquering small Republics. But you can compare the plethora of recent democracies  all of which are really hybrids of the US and UK model. South American systems tend to look more like the US  Europe more like the UK. France  is a middle ground.   South America being more unstable probably has more to do with colonial history and economics than a reflection on the system itself. The Hitler example for what it's worth  mostly shows that if 30-40% of the population prefers an Authoritarian Government  and the economy is in a tailspin  no amount of separation of powers will do anything.    But I will say this  the best and brightest Americans  working in the US government and drafting foreign policy certainly think the Parliament System is better. It's not like the UK dominated post WW2. We've gotten to straight up draft a few other countries Constitutions (Iraq  Japan  Germany) and heavily influenced most of Asia/Eastern Europe. The reason Parliamentary Systems dominate the democratic world  is because it's what America recommends  for better or worse.

If the Treaty of Versailles had never been written up the way it had been  and the Germans not forced into absolute poverty  Hitler probably wouldn't have willingly joined the NSDAP and risen to power as the Fuhrer.

You've confused ""moral given a particular moral code"" with ""absolutely moral""  just like every other moral realist.  Yes  in Hitler's moral code  the holocaust was the ""right thing for him to do"". I think he was wrong. That's how moral systems work.  But that doesn't mean that anyone else has to think it was the right thing for him to do.  All you've said is ""unless you think that Hitler believed the holocaust was the right thing to do""  which is trivially true.  Relative to my moral code  and presumably yours  the holocaust was the wrong thing for Hitler to do.   You people keep saying ""right thing for him to do"" as if there is an ""absolute"" right thing for him to do  which is simply not the case."

KaiserFritz,WritingPrompts,2015-03-17 15:30,"He held the receiver in his hand for a second  absorbing the words that he had just heard...  ""Your Mother is dead""...  His grief overflowed him like a wave  but he held his composure.  He had always had the ability to control his outside demeanor  even while his soul was awash with grief.  He had been preparing for this day  ever since he found out about his Mother's cancer.  ""I will be right down."" and he replaced the receiver in the cradle...He allowed himself a moment of pure anguish  allowed one wracking sob to escape  before he replaced the mask that he would show to the world.  He looked around at his small room  with it's half completed paintings and water colors he was producing to apply to art school.  At 18 years of age  he knew he was destined to be a great artist.  His work was so far superior to others of his friends that he was sure that he would have his choice of schools to attend.  ""My Mother is dead""...he thought to himself.  He had lost his Father some years ago.  He was a heavy drinker  and a lout  with a Government job that made him feel more important than he was  but his lack of control made it impossible for him to be respected.    His Mother  however  was an absolute Saint.  ""She was the only one who really understood me...who really cared for me""...and now she was gone.  He grabbed his coat and checked his reflection in the mirror.  He smoothed his hair.  It was too long...always fell in his eyes.  He meant to cut it  but hadn't had the time for such an unimportant thing.  He looked at his reflection.  He was a handsome young man.  and he had his Mother's eyes.    For a moment he felt another pang of grief  which he promptly locked away.  ""I suppose I will have to get it cut before the funeral"" he said while pulling on his coat.  He opened the door and passed out into the hall.  He listened to the music and chatter from the other rooms...Just noise really.  He had never really gotten on with his school mates.  He was so far above them.  They were worried about such petty things  none of them did anything seriously.  He was glad none of them were in the hallway  he wouldn't have wanted to talk to any of them now.  He may not be able to hold back what he really thought of them.  And when he didn't hold back  it just caused him trouble...trouble he didn't need...not now.  He sprinted down the steps  and out the door.  He saw the large black car waiting with the rear door open.  How odd.  he expected a relative  or a medical vehicle  not a limousine.  He looked into the car and saw an old man.  He recognized him as the Doctor who had been his pediatrician and family Doctor for all his life.    ""Step in Son""  ""We need to talk"".  He slid into the back seat across from the Doctor.  ""I see you are rather well composed for someone who has just become an orphan."" he said with that slight drawl he had.  The old Doctor smelled a bit like mothballs and dead flesh.  A smell that was off putting to most  but since he had grown up with it  to him it smelled like home.  ""Looks can be deceiving"" he said  in as matter of fact a voice as he could.  In no way would he let the Doctor see any emotion.  Emotion was weakness  and he would not be weak.  ""That is so true  my son.  But I know you loved your Mother dearly  and her death  even if expected  cannot be easy on you.""  ""It is a fact of life...we knew this was coming.  Being overly melodramatic would not change that fact.  Would you have me cry like a baby?""  ""No...I would not have expected anything less from you...What will you do now?""  ""I will apply to art schools and become the professional artist that I have always planned to be.   Why would that change?""  It shouldn't...Have you thought about what you would do if you don't get accepted to an art school?""  ""Not get accepted?!""  The thought had never occurred to him ""Why would I not get accepted?""  ""I was just curious if you made plans for that alternative.""  He allowed the thought to circulate in his mind  even without his conscious will to do so  plans started to form within his head.  ""I am sure whatever happens  i will land on my feet""...  ""Of that  I have no doubt"".  he realized that the car had not moved since he got in it.  ""Will we be traveling today?"" he asked.  The Doctor replied ""Not we  but just you.  I will be catching a flight in a few hours  so I need to get to the airport.  I will check in with you in a few days when I get back  OK?""  ""Suit yourself""  The Doctor slid out of the car ""This car will take you to your Mother.  Your Sister is already there  she will need your help with the arrangements""  With that  he shut the door and the limo pulled away and made the corner.  The Doctor flagged down a second vehicle as it emerged from around the corner.  In the back seat was a man who was old enough to make the Doctor seem young in comparison.  He was strapped into the back seat and hooked up to an oxygen supply.  His liver spotted hands pulled the mask aside as the doctor got in.  ""How is it with him?""  The Doctor fastened his seat belt and replied ""It's amazing  actually.  it seems like a 100 percent success.""  The ancient man looked at him through his yellow eyes with skepticism.  Alternating between looking at the Doctor and gazing at a picture of the Boy he held in his hand  ""We have been down this road before  Doctor  and it has always led to disappointment.""  ""But all of the tests...ALL of them have come back positive...and we have followed the process to the letter.  We had never gotten to the death of the Mother before without a break!  and his blood proves it!  He is an exact match!""  ""If that is the case  and you are so sure  than I must meet him""  ""That has all been arranged.  You will get to meet him in about 6 months  after he has received his rejection notices from the Art schools.  You will be able to watch his training in person from that point on until his military service  you will be his first contact with his destiny""  ""I hope you are as good of a geneticist as you claim to be  so that I will have that 6 months and the time to indoctrinate him...No matter how long you can keep us alive  time is running out  We must have success! Herr Doctor.""  ""Do not fear  Herr Secretary Borrman  we have not failed.  That boy not only looks like  but for all practical intents and purposes  he is  Adolf Hitler!"

You  telling me that I am  in anyway  supporting these disturbed people is a disappointing way to justify yourself of calling them subhuman. Calling these sad people subhuman does not change the fact that they are humans. The same physiology and brain as any other humans  they represent the most hated parts of ourselves  the most disgusting parts of our minds. Calling them subhuman is an even worse crime  it suggests that we are superior  that we are better than that kind of thing. That is the easiest way to slip and fall  to form another Adolf Hitler  another ISIL  another Charles Manson.

UseMe4yourFleshlight,AskReddit,2015-03-17 16:13,If you want people to take your country seriously  you've got to nuke japan. That's how America won WW2 all by itself while the UK  France  and Russia were sitting around trading tug jobs with Hitlerini.
ramblingpariah,AskScienceFiction,2015-03-17 16:14,It could be that he was cloned using elements of Hitler's DNA  or some mixture of Hitler's genetic material that was then tweaked/modified/upgraded  intending to breed some sort of uber-fuhrer or something.

If you want a hugbox go somewhere else.    &gt It doesn't contribute to the discussion  which is the real reason the downvote button is there in the first place.  And you don't get to decide what others find contribute to discussion or not.

The American Civil war also birth a great nation with a great society for a time.  Hitler could have won the war  there is a possibility.  And we know the tragedies from USSR and China that happens.  There will always be a time of chaos and men who will direct it in a better or worse direction.
AntsCamera,opieandanthony,2015-03-17 16:18,I would love for him to interview Hitler  imagine the questions you could ask such a man  the info and insight into history he could give you...   Now imagine what Opie and Jim would ask...  You ever go into the bathroom after Eva and smell her doodies?  What the fuck is a D day? Bat schnitzel in the fuhrer-bunker?  You had liquid poopies?  Who is this Churchhill and Roosevelt guy you keep bitching about  they are not important  have you seen what Bruce Jenner is doing Adolph?  Where you going.....Why are those men pointing guns at us  we were just having fun  being edgy!  What were you promoting again?  *Gunshot followed Sam crying and his career ending*  
dubsteping,worldnews,2015-03-17 16:19,"ok lets play this game.  &gt How is Russia's behavior doing anything to help or solve any problems? How will it possibly affect the status quo in any way other than getting people killed? ""No one can blame them"" for threatening the entire world on behalf of nationalistic pride? I sure as hell can.  National security is important  there is nothing they can do to alleviate US attacks except fight back  the alternative is to accept US dominance and bend the knee  Russia culturally and traditionally does not do that  no one dominates Russians  not since mongol times. They are not left with any options  its either do what you are told or we continue our attacks  the US has left no room for compromise  its either you let us win or we keep hitting you over the head. Russia is choosing to fight  under this ultimatum  same way they did with hitler and napoleon. This has saved them in the past  perhaps it will save them now  the Washington war hawks are evil  greedy and they are cowards  they will have to back down or Russia will unleash such terrible vengeance that generations yet unborn will cry out in anguish (that was for comedic effect)   The country simply has no choice  let the bullies beat you down or rise up and fight  perhaps then the bullies will leave you alone. simple school yard tactics  we are all kids anyway and then we die.   &gt The baltics and poland have had ""salt poured in their eyes"" by Russia for a long time  but for some reason this didn't give them the right to go to NATO for protection in your world of double standards.  Russia does not do these things anymore  they had good reason to go into Georgia (Georgia attacked Russian peace keepers) Ossetia and Ukraine (what did the US do with a similar situation in cuba? what will it likely do if Russia regime changed Canada or mexico? try to think objectively)    Russia doesn't bother nations (they have a noninterventionist policy  while the US has the exact opposite)  at least not as much as the USSR  but remember  when the USSR did bad things it was not controlled by Russians  but by Georgia  stalin was Georgian not Russian its like blaming spain alone for the sins of the EU.  or blaming Kansas for something done by the people of Washington. The USSR was a huge place encompassing many nations and they were not always leaders of this Union of republics  why are they then to blame for its sins? especially when the leadership during bad times was held by someone from one of these republics and it was not Russia.   &gt When was the last time a multipolar world brought an era with less conflict than a hegemonic world? Certainly not during the lifetime of anyone currently living. Multiple poles of power didn't do anything to ""check"" or ""balance"" the cold war. Or World War 2. Or World War 1.  Look you can say all these things because you won the birth lottery and are living in a nice place  what of all the millions who have died or are suffering because of US hegemony? You live in paradise while the rest of the worlds population (the majority) live under the US hefty boot  while it deems who can live and who should die for its whims and fancy.   This tyranny and abuse of power and position  is now leading to WW3  just because those that they have consistently stompped on are fucking tired of it and are looking to revolt. Look at the disgusting groups that have risen precisely as a result of US policies  look at people having their heads cut of and eyes gorged out. Its a fucking nightmare to be frank.   &gt You are clearly missing the irony that Russia's push to challenge a unipolar world is bring the world closer to war  As I said above the conditions of this unipolar world are leading people to rise up  no one wants to be constantly bullied  no one likes it  and least of all the Russians  they are just more educated organized and culturally stable to rise up and say NO! no more  while the rest resort to animalistic and evil terrorism. China is in the same boat as the Russians  india as well  latin America etc. The only one seating at the podium decreeing this and that and deciding how people live and who dies is the US and its handful of rich minions. A corrupt force trying to rule over the world through deceit  force and trickery.    &gt I'm no supporter of the US or their actions  but that doesn't mean I'm going to support cutting the nose to spite the face and fuck up the whole world just to take the US down a peg. That's kindergarten tactics.  You are right  you and I don't support the US government  but I love the American people  and I would not support cutting off the nose to spite the stupid proverbial face  but I call a spade a spade  people are fed up  wishful thinking will not quiet them down  change is what is needed  change that Obama promised and thereby excited the world  and gave people hope  he has failed or has lied to us all. OR his handlers  the greedy corps that run America  have forced him  he perhaps doesn't want to die  just like Bobby kennedy. Perhaps that's what has kept them in power and US presidents seemingly evil  the fear that those guys will blow their brains out all over the street using their own SS or so.   This tyranny is reaching a boiling point  and will boil over soon enough  the status quo cannot realistically continue for long  we will all die (weapons have gotten too terrible these days) if they don't back down  if they don't relinquish their grip on states and try to form a more equitable world  if not Russia then someone else  its just a matter of time.     So lets not just blindly blame the Russians   lets blame the real culprits  the people making everyone go crazy with their oppression  no one likes or wants to be a slave  people sooner or later rise up  that's human nature  same as the French revolution  soon enough the downtrodden masses will have had enough and someone will cart-in the guillotine. Its inescapable  if not Russia then someone else  but presently Russia is the only country strong enough to resist  when shit starts flying all the disenfranchised and abused will flock to them  but the battle may not leave anything left... That is the great fear  but what other choice does the world have? perhaps if the US was willing to negotiate rather than place ultimatums  we can all live happily ever after... but I shudder to think what will happen if the US hardlines and tries to call the Russians bluff... I know Russians they don't fucking bluff  when they had it  they have had it and they wouldn't give a fuck  they have a saying ingrained into them  its better to die than live on your knees. That's the attitude that has saved them for centuries.   "

The government is destroying our society from the inside out and we're letting them. Like I said  go read a history book on political grabs and manipulation. You'll find it's all the same from the communist rule of the USSR to Hitler's Nazi regime. If I could give free healthcare to every citizen in America  I would do it in a jiffy!

ggthxnore,KotakuInAction,2015-03-17 16:23,&gt You do realize GG has real  self-admitted neo-nazis in its ranks  right?  Here's the thing: anyone can use a hashtag. I have no doubt a few Neo-Nazis have tweeted something in support in GG  but can you show any evidence of *GG* supporting *them*? Me and Hitler are both vegetarians  but that doesn't mean we share the same beliefs about everything else.  Avowed Neo-Nazi Ian Miles Cheong  on the other hand  gets quite vocal and unreserved support from your side of things. He's changed  you can't hold his past against him just because he wanted the filth of Asia to be cleansed by the fires of the Aryan faith  or whatever his exact wording was.  You guys with your rigid dogma and your ideological purity tests and your regular purges and show trials might find this a bit hard to understand  but we're not all in ideological lockstep over here. We disagree about lots of things. It's considered healthy.
Orion78762,islam,2015-03-17 16:25,I think it's a combination of Americans being subject to 9/11  feeling Nazism is dead because of Hitler's death  and even those who actively acknowledge it feel that it's not a huge problem  given we have Neo-nazis in America  and they haven't done anything yet that makes it such a surprise to Americans.
NoSpicyFood,politics,2015-03-17 16:25,The only thing more annoying than comparing things to Hitler is the notion that any comparison to Hitler is automatically wrong simply because it's a cliche. Cotton's comparison actually was bad because there is no modern Hitler figure in his analogy  but it isn't wrong merely for 'invoking' Hitler.

TheVitaminAvenger,politics,2015-03-17 16:32,"&gt You think if  say  Muslims in Europe were armed to teeth it was any better for them? I would argue it would only make things worse.  Better economically?  No.  But what it would do is prevent the government from sending in people to mass detain  impose curfews or do anything else to diminish their rights.  I am also talking about the US given how firearms are a god given right.  &gt Would guns change anything? They had the whole country along with its military turned against them. At this point  they have already lost. It would be more bloody and perhaps more heroic  but guns would not prevent the government from doing what they wanted. If anything  it would have been showcased by the propaganda that Jews are violent and dangerous.  Of course guns would have changed it  why do you think Hitler disarmed them?  It would turned out better for them without a doubt.  In order to suppress a group of people you can't simply destroy everything  you need the infrastructure for after.  It takes boots on the ground which is why guns are invaluable.    As for them being killed anyways  look at the insurgents in Iraq  they have the entire might of the US military raining down on them and nearly a decade and a half later they're still fighting.  The insurgents from the first desert war were often times not armed with anything but bolt action rifles and still were able to fight back quite sucessfully.    When the alternative is be slaughtered like live stock  anything is better.    As for your white Christian stuff  you are simply biased in how you perceive ""white Christians"" act.  Your assumption that a group of people that comprises 60-70% of the population of the US acts in only one way is simply not true.  "

boominnewman,AdviceAnimals,2015-03-17 16:47,Yep  I guess you're right. I guess we shouldn't judge Hitler or ISIS because we haven't lived in their shoes. I suppose our entire criminal justice system is flawed because the judges and juries just don't understand what it's like to be in a certain situation. /s   I know those are extreme examples  but people will judge regardless of if you want them to or not  and they absolutely should. Without judgement  we're essentially without moral. Basically your only argument is that my opinion doesn't count  based on the assumption you're making  That I am not a parent. If you wanted to have time to spend playing games (much like a child)  maybe you shouldn't have had children. Being a parent is about making sacrifices for your children (like quitting a video game two minutes before you wanted to).

TKInstinct,todayilearned,2015-03-17 16:55,"Rommel was part of a conspiracy  of which the ultimate goal was to kill Hitler. Hitler did eventually find out but  because Rommel was such a highly decorated figure in the Military and was such a figurehead to the public he was given a option on how he would ultimately be recorded as dying. He could a.) Choose to commit suicide  which he did choose. He was driven out to where no one was around and left in a car  where he swallowed a cyanide pill.  He did this for several reasons  the biggest being that if he chose to go through a public battle he would be dragged through a muck and his image tarnished. His family would have also been dragged through the muck and  would ultimately face execution. Finally  according to Wikipedia  his Army staff would have been executed.  Hitler was known to employ what was known as ""Kangaroo Courts"" which were courts that appeared to be official courts without bias. However  in reality they leaned towards the prosecution and there would have been no way for him to be acquitted.   He would have also been kicked out of the Army  dishonorably and stripped of all of his accomplishments for the Reich up until that point.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Death"

Right now my tribe is trying to get federal recognition because our treaty is with England and predates america. But a Casino 120 miles away is lobbying politicians to refuse to recognize the tribe because they fear that a casino might be built (it won't because the tribe is poor)  and they don't want competition. Neighboring counties don't want it because they don't want stores in the area to sell goods without taxes.   also there are plenty of other ways the government screws over the natives to this day. like this: http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/13/white-house-responds-stop-apache-land-grab-petition-158680

The years leading up to that monumental catastrophe were filled with international treaties and arms control agreements.   &gt  The Treaty of Versailles  which ended the First World War  imposed strong restrictions on Germany’s military forces — on paper. The Washington Naval Agreements of 1922 imposed restrictions on all the major naval powers of the world — on paper.

Taph,NoStupidQuestions,2015-03-17 17:35,"There are examples of Germans such as [Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) who were ""Nazis"" due to circumstances outside of their control. Many military men  such as Stauffenberg  became Nazis by default when the Nazis gained power. That doesn't mean that they held to Nazi ideals. Stauffenberg even attempted to assassinate Hitler in [Operation Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Valkyrie) and was nearly successful. He was executed as a traitor for his role so  while he was *technically* a Nazi because he was in the German military when the Nazis took over he obviously didn't have a great liking for them and was a central figure in the [German Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Resistance_to_Nazism) within the Wehrmact (i.e.  the German military). Wikipedia [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Resistance_to_Nazism#Resistance_in_the_Army_1938.E2.80.9342) that there was a Resistance within the German army from 1938 - 1942 so there were certainly other ""Nazis"" who were good guys  or at least not as bad as the Nazis themselves."

RallyUp,television,2015-03-17 17:41,Hang on though  the Nazi's really were trying to take over all of Europe and eradicate as many of what they called 'sub human' minorities off the earth as they could. A shitload of that was complacency with country and kin  just like the U.S. and it's militarized youth are seeing today. But at the end of the day if the world hadn't stomped that shit out  they may well have overwhelmed the British before Japan forced America into the war. That really was a war. It was conquest on the part of the Germans  and the reason they let old Adolf become such a force had a lot to do with the perceived wrongs against the German people by the rest of the world  but France in particular. They always had it out for the French. They wanted to wait the British and the Soviet Russians out but he ended up scaring Stalin with his (Hitler) heavy handed tactics and overall blitzkrieg approach.    But I digress. They were truly an evil force of hatred that had to be destroyed. I agree with you on the other points but when it comes to legitimate Nazi's I have to draw a line. Even today  knowing what I know and the revelations of modern shit like Internet and social networking  I would still join the fight against Nazism if it grew to the point it was in the 30's and 40's. That shit was for the most part  just pure evil. Geo politically based evil. But pure fucking evil.

Hitler secures Russian industry and the Caucuses oil and pushes on to Britain. Germany is now under Hitler's control.  Although one thing I find fascinating is that if you go back to the beginning of time and change just one of the constants of physics very slightly  the whole universe would be unrecognisable  it would be governed by subtly different laws of physics and unimaginably different in its make up  not necessarily stars and rocks as we know it today.

Not a single liberal  and very few rational conservatives have a place on that network  and all of them seem to have the same convenient talking points. Many people buy into the idea of the ""liberal media"" which has the effect of making people unwilling to look at sources without an inherent conservative bias because they view that as the true propaganda. This in turn just reinforces their beliefs until you have poor people believing in flat taxes  trickle-down ecenomics  and the Christ like nature of Ronald Reagan  they then wrap this pile of self serving shit in the shiny veneer of ""it will help the middle class just like it did in the 80's  does everyone remember how great the 80's where?

Don't kill  don't commit theft  do not oppress  do not invade  do not blow up wedding parties to target a SUSPECTED terrorist. Do not wage wars for financial gain  or any reason other than the defense of yourself and your loved ones.   Are you saying being a murderer or rapist IS something to be proud of? I say those are the things to abhor  to dehumanize.   Like I said  I don't murder  steal  or cheat. I provide goods for those who cannot afford it  give food and money to the destitute. I extol the open desire for all to have open and equal rights in life. The right to live without being oppressed  by governments or religions. I demand the right for people who love each other to marry  regardless of gender  or race  or beliefs.   ""So many people"" like whom? Who all has said the above  verbatum  and meant it? ""For the good of the nation"" is not the above concept  by the way  before you include Mao  Hitler  or Stalin. "
Advertise_this,todayilearned,2015-03-17 17:49,Ah  the other war Hitler started.
Smoothrich,holocaust,2015-03-17 17:49,I agree with your conclusions honestly  but too many cherry pick their sources and draw bizarre interpretations from them like saying Hitler wasn't to blame for anything. All he did was engineer international relations to create excuses to invade sovereign nations  one after another. And he talked of Eastern Europe like a Manifest Destiny that made Americans genocide Native Americans and claim all their land for settlers and immigration. A world where no one stopped Hitler  I and many people I know would've never been born  cuz our living ancestors were on the precipice of ethnic destruction. How can people judge the preponderance of text  Hitler and his inner circles orders  manifestos  speeches  policies  and actions then say they didn't want to kill every Slavic Jewish Romanian etc undesirable people and resettle the land for the glory of a German Empire? That's the Third Reich  the crux of Nazism  the entire point of everything! And the Holocaust is the memory of all those innocents who were victims of it  and should be seen as more than Zionist bullshit like Israeli nutjobs spin it as. Many Holocausts have happened in history  only that was one in living memory and it is very important to learn lessons from the survivors who just want it to never happen again. ISIS for example could be the next Third Reich with their caliphate being exactly the same concept.

mattmast89,GetMotivated,2015-03-17 17:54,"You are seriously a fucking idiot. You cannot separate the fact that defending historical truth is different than being a diehard apologetical fan of the Catholic Church. Someone gave historical fact and you refuse to de  &gt I'm not giving you a reference for the systematic rape of native children either. Still happened.  Wow  fucking stupidity once again from you. All you are spouting is bullshit without any proof. This argument isn't about the systematic rape of native children (though I am interested if there is any proof about that too). I shouldn't be pulling teeth here for a fact that you kinda claim to be commonly known. You remind me of some people that I had the misfortune to work with that would start an argument  I would ask for proof  then somehow jump to a completely different argument. They also would have terrible logic and know nothing factual. And  they would always jump in with more out of this world facts (like your native children fact and castrati) when they know they are losing with what they started on.  Ultimately  you wanted to deny historical fact because of a ""fact"" that you are currently unable to prove (maybe because you learned it was a lie but refuse to say you were wrong).   How about we use a different example that relates to this situation(please don't fixate on the story itself tho and start another completely different argument about it  because I notice you like to go down rabbit trails. Yes  it may be a bad example  but work with me here).   Say someone posts that Hitler liked to scoop people's eyeball out and use them as an ice cream topping. Another person comes and replies that this story is entirely false. Then you come and say ""Well  I won't give him the benefit of the doubt because he like to dress up as Darth Vader and choke babies [citation needed]. I would then come in and say  first: ""Where is the proof he did dressed up as Darth Vader and choked babies?"". Second: ""It's ridiculous to deny something historical just because you have another (false) story about what terrible things he did"". I wouldn't be defending Hitler and I definitely wouldn't say he never did evil things. I'm just questioning your proof on a ""fact"" you mentioned and questioning your terrible logic. Then  you would reply mentioning ""Well  just look up the Holocaust!!!!! See???? I'm right!"" (which wouldn't be related to what the real discussion is about)  So  in conclusion  I am not sticking up for the Church here. I am merely saying you have no knowledge of logic and are using lies  not historical truths  to defend yourself. An argument can be both factual and logical  just logical  just factual  or neither. You initial post here was neither logical nor factual. That is why I replied to you. I am not arguing about the other things the Church did  so leave the native children  castrati  and anything else out of this argument. They only detract from your terrible logic and lack of facts from your first post here. So  you could say  I wasn't defending the Church  just attacking your stupid line of thinking. It just so happened I saw this line of thinking in a discussion about the Church. And  yes  if I see another person who makes stupid logical leaps and spits out historical falsehoods  I will address them as well (provided I'm not busy with something else).  Hopefully you finally understand and not drag in so many other stories and ""facts"" that I do not care to argue about because I am not here to defend/explain every action the Church does. Leave that to the priests and other Catholic academics/writers. "
blackiehideaki,fivenightsatfreddys,2015-03-17 17:54,I understood the joke  I laughed to it at the beginning  but this is just too much dumbness in a single picture.

RamblinRambo3,european,2015-03-17 17:55,"&gt  Also  you can not possibly objectively equate Bolsheviks to ordinary Russians.  No such thing as ""ordinary"" Russians. It's like saying that islam is a peaceful religion with only a few nutjobs. Russians are like white Arabs. All their bright ones were murdered by the commies and what's left are 200 million idiots all programmed to do whatever the fuck Kremlin says. It's a nation of people easily manipulated by propaganda and everyone who's ever been to Russia or had anything to do with Russia knows this. Russians can never ever be trusted. Ever. Just can't. It's like swimming with a great white shark that hasn't killed anyone yet.  &gt Putin is a formidable leader who fights against foreign interest and for the sovereignty of his nation.  That I have to sadly say is utter bullshit. Putin is a power hungry corrupt oligarch like the rest of the former KGB men. He surrounds himself with corrupt people and fill their and his own pockets while doing it. In Russia it's all about who you know and what they can do to for you. It runs through the whole society and anyone who's got experience with Russia will confirm this for you.  He doesn't care about Russia  he only cares about himself and his legacy. He's building his own little empire or dirt and that's where his interests end.  &gt We would be blessed to have such a great leader anywhere in Europe.  He's basically the corrupt EU leaders boiled into one person. Seriously I from the bottom of my heart wish you'd look more into this fucker that is Putin.  &gt I see many parallels with A.H.  The only parallel there is  is that they both speak about doing what's best for their people. Difference is that Hitler actually cared about his people. Putin doesn't.  &gt I agree with Le Pen and German Nationalists that we should have a strong economical Partnership with Russia  The only thing Russia can offer us is natural resource. They don't have any real industry and their economy is completely at the mercy of those natural resources and without shame they'll use that to secure their interests. Look at continental Europe. You guys are completely fucked as you're dependent on Russian gas. We learned our lesson up here and we have heating and power even if Russia cut the gas supply. We only use gas for 10 % of our energy production of which all comes from Russia. But all our plants are equipped so that they can switch fuel within 24 hrs.  Putting ones fate in the hands of Russia in any shape or form is extremely dangerous and fool-hearted. Instead we should focus on growing our internal European market of more than 500 million people. We should invest heavily on research and science so that we are even less dependent on natural gas and oil. This also has great strategic value.  Russia is and will forever be an untrustworthy partner for Europe. History has shown us that since the inception of Russia. And if we cannot learn from hundreds of years of history we as Europeans don't deserve to exist."

Clay8288314,shield,2015-03-17 17:55,Well superpowers in humans is still very volatile.  When you look at the avengers only 3 are truly superhuman.  First is Thor but he is alien so his powers are natural.  That leaves hulk and cap left in the picture.  Both of them have their origins tied to the super soldier program which has had incredibly mixed results.  It created captain america  but then again it created the hulk who is incredibly dangerous and volatile.  Those are the only two heroes it has created and one is a creature that can be easily set off is incredibly dangerous causing incredible damage and destruction whenever banner loses his cool.  This condition ruined his chances at a normal life.  That's just the hero's it made.  It also made deathlok who was exploited and turned into a supersoldier for hydra. Along with him there was garret who became a hydra leader and was a psychopath.  The abomination who truly is an abomination and a psychopath and last but not least it made the red skull.  He was LITERALLY worse than Hitler.  He was a genocidal maniac who almost destroyed the United States.  Not counting the super soldier soldier there is scorch who was also exploited and turned into a supervillain then killed and that one factory worker who was sent to hell.  There is also Cal who absolutely crazy the absorbing man yet another hydra agent Skye's mom who was butchered for her powers and then given to Whitehall who became the Immortal hydra head.  Then we have Donnie gill who lost his best friend then was brainwashed and was killed and that dude with the darkforce a super stalker.  Raina turned into a freak who can't even move without giving herself internal damage.  Basically in the Marvel cinematic universe when you get powers the odds are very very very low it will be a good thing for you

I'd probably mash all three into a wildly inaccurate story about how the president ate part of the Loch Ness monster and now has thyroid cancer that will turn him into a Sasquatch. Failing that nessy. 7. I'd still marry them maybe I'd regret it and hate life later on but from what I've heard that's how marriage works right? 8. Definitely would read it. If it had effects on me I'd be curious to see if reading it backwards or upside down has any effects. 9. Toilet break phone call time. No answer then I'm outta there. 10. Depends if he meets me before or after payday but probably too much money. 11. I find this question felinist (racist to cats). I'm sure different cats have different personalities and preferences of reading material and don't deserve to be judged because they are feline. 12. I'd probably drink and smoke myself to near death. I guess I'd have to correct peoples grammar on the internet to enjoy my superior intellect while I still had it. Would be cool to set up a charity live streaming channel with cameras around my house. I'd probably start by gluing money to objects in my house. Set some other amusing traps for myself. Finally I'd draw simple pictures on the walls reminding me how to do simple things like eat. Hire a butler and hope he stays with me out of pity. 13. I don't think I'd enjoy suffocating in space. Definitely Europe unless I've already had my brain surgery in which case I'll probably forget how to breathe anyway. I could be the first unintelligent form of intelligent life up there. Would be nice to be remembered as the mystery man found dribbling and floating around on the big space rock. 14. I'd cover them in cushions and then kick away. Maybe run into a wall  play dead and then deny anything had happened. 15. I don't think I'd enjoy watching either. If I was artistically shown as awesome I'm down for that. Would be a great way to meet people. Hi I'm the subject of that film you loved. I wouldn't really like a documentary of my life existing. All my secrets would disappear. Lots of awkward conversations would follow but I guess less people I know would find it.

Awkward_moments,todayilearned,2015-03-17 18:06,"My history isnt the best but I dont see anything about WWII showing the Nazi's to be cowards. Germany had just come out of ""The Great War""  ""The War to End All Wars"" and they had fared by far the worst because of it. It was such a big war people thought it was literally the end of war because no one could possibly want to start another war  and this was from a time when countries had been in a different war every generation. The Nazi then fought against countries that owned most of the world. Just look at this map:  http://balagan.info/wp-content/images/war/world-maps/1938_map_colonisation.png  How you can be fighting France and the UK in Africa  fighting wars in Europe with the commonwealth bringing in men from another 3 continents and US supplying everything  then also decide you want to take on the USSR as well. I dont think the Nazis gave up easy either  they fought till the end.  The Nazi did a lot of shit  but they were not cowards. I don't understand all the crap they did and people make up stuff. Hitler was a great public speaker  one of the best of all time but you mention that and people hate you  I really honestly want to understand why."

Wikiwakagiligala,europe,2015-03-17 18:15,Eh? I hope your not saying they are right... This isn't male culture  it is human culture. Look at any animal  the leader is the strong &amp  confidant one  because that is how power works  we give power to the people that we think will use it to defend our interests.   This is also how old leaders (kings) got their positions  they fought for it  which why so many leaders today have been in the military (tradition). Which  like social upbringing among other things  has made men more popular leaders  because when you can choose between 5 men &amp  5 women then you want the huge deep-voiced bear holding a sword.   What machismo means (from my experience) is not the same as what is going on here. He isn't flexing his muscles and talking about how much of a man he is. He is engaging in politics  which means making deals  threatening enemies  seeking out interests  ect.   Having a world where everybody could help each other with peace and love would be great  but the idea that men are to blame for conflict is stupid &amp  sexist. Men are given the role of fighting the conflict out  but that would be like blaming women for supporting Hitler because they didn't fight against him. If you go to Russia its not about men wanting Putin to do these things  it is men &amp  women in Russia who support Putin because they think he is standing up for them.  Despite people's stereotypes of men  women are just as likely to be aggressive  [for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eX-t6laaf8).

JFVarlet,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 18:35,Well  it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups  as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks  more the lower-middle officers  especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests  but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism  Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy  even though there's a King  Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan  on the other hand  there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor  so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations  which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.

You can't reasonably draw parallels between a political party that called for the execution of millions and one that simply makes bad decisions when it comes to the future of Canada.  Sure  there may be *some* correlating values between the Nazis and the Conservatives  but Nazi Germany is the very definition of the extreme case.  By citing them for comparison  you weaken our position because *Nazi* doesn't mean ""in the pocket of big business"" so much as it means ""murderous fascists with a penchant for gas chambers and genocide"".  By drawing this comparison you identify yourself (and by association  the rest of us) as someone too lazy to make a rational argument.  Godwin's law exists because people like you take the inflammatory and lazy route when talking about serious issues that demand more than short-sighted hyperbole.  If we were talking about eugenics and genocide  then by all means  let's make parallels with Hitler  but we're not  so let's not pretend that invoking Godwin suppresses any meaningful dialogue here."

NavajoChodeTalker,todayilearned,2015-03-17 18:46,Rommel was a key conspirator in the attempt to assassinate Hitler on July 20th  1944. He fought to defend his country and he fought against that oppressive genocidal regime.
TheArthedain,StarWars,2015-03-17 18:47,We are talking about controlling the galaxy here  billions upon billions of people could rise up against the emporer and eventually did  so he couldn't make a move until everyone felt scared enough to give him power to 'save' them from the threat. Just look at how Hitler gained power. Very similar.  Emperor created evil  said we need to defeat wvil but that he needs more power to do it  gets the political power  eliminates the only threat to his power (jedi)  gets rid of the evil  and doesn't give the judicial and sovereign power back. Now he owns everything. Brilliant way to do it. Plus it's the sith way to be devilish and manipulative.    
Abe_Vigoda,todayilearned,2015-03-17 18:47,No shit they were kept secret.  Stalin was probably a bigger cunt than Hitler even.  Britain and France were double teaming Germany before the war which caused Hitler to invade Poland. Hitler allied with Stalin briefly to split Poland but the alliance fell apart after Germany got pissed that the Soviets weren't playing 'fair'.  The allies only ended up allying with the Russians just to beat the Nazis but they weren't friendly with Stalin  who they knew was a massive cock.

AquilaGlobumAncora,AskReddit,2015-03-17 18:51,"Most politicians only talk about infrastructure  Hitler was the infrastructure king. Dude built dams  bridges  improved roads and came up with the autobahn  the first highway.  He had a huge animal rights campaign and passed some of the first modern laws regarding animal cruelty. He was even vegetarian and encouraged others to do so.  Hitler also mandated that all employers provide lunch breaks to its workers and IIRC something about having bathrooms as well and the 40 hour work week.  He killed the national bank  the same banks that led the worldwide depression.  He also fought usury. The same nationalized banks that Hitler was against was the same banks that JFK and Occupy Wall Street was against.  Hitler also tried to deport Jews wealth intact to Palestine and Madagascar for some reason. Supposedly he didn't want to kill anyone. Also  the whole ""Hitler was a racist"" thing is untrue. Hitler had black  mongolian  islamic  and other races in his ranks. He even had certified Nazi Qurans printed for his islamic troops. He just thought that the races should be separate yet equal and that they should strive to make themselves better to strengthen their race so that humanity as a whole improved.   As far as the whole Master Race thing goes Nazi Germany completely dominated the 1936 Olympics and it was simply him pushing the strong and smart should reproduce  while those with inheritable disease should not."

Lightning-Dust,videos,2015-03-17 18:57,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here  as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade  I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all  it was spur-of-the-moment  I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches  anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15  I understand physics better than him  and I owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer  but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics  so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree  and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example  I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology  I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering  there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it  though  because I'd rather defend my maturity  since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII  I would be against executing him. In fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it  I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions  it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral  but it's unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things. I love everyone  even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack  I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then  I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them  I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men  and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women  I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them  if you've even made it this far. In closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community  where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so I guess other people agreed (though  granted  it was a pretty low-traffic post  only about a dozen competing comments). And  uh  I'm a pretty good moderator. All that  and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me?"

That's from the show Danger 5  if you've never seen it fucking watch it  that's possibly the least absurd joke in the entire show. The entire thing is a spinoff of the old 60's action-team movies (like the Japanese sentai shows with less spandex and megazords)  it's like Airplane and Blazing Saddles had a child and raised in on Monty Python and PCP.  In minute one of the first episode a couple of Nazi zeppelins with arcade claws steal the Eiffel tower  a French revolutionary kills herself hilariously  and a Nazi German Shepherd puppet-dog commands soldiers to kill the revolutionaries in the name of Hitler. Minute two is even more absurd.  It's on Netflix  go watch it. Danger 5 is amazing.

There is a long tradition of simplistic ideologues rejecting science that didn't fit in with their belief systems. Adolf Hitler rejected what he called ""Jewish Physics"" in favour of ""Aryan Physics"" and drove Einstein and many other brilliant physicists out of European giving the Allies the expertise to develop the atomic bomb.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik#Effect_on_the_German_nuclear_program  Joseph Stalin rejected establishe­­­­­­­d agricultur­­­­­­­al science in favour of the nonsense promoted by Trofim Lysenko and the result was that the Soviet Union could not feed it's own population and in fact millions starved.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko  Mao Tse-tung ignored the establishe­­­­­­­d science of metallurgy and embarked on a program of small-scal­­­­­­­e production of iron and steel.

HawaiiFO,todayilearned,2015-03-17 19:19,"Briton also had plans to take out 90% of Soviet oil production by bombing Baku from Iran/Iraq if the German/Soveit pact had held and they kept trading oil with Germany.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pike  ""an oil shortage would cripple the Red Army and Soviet Air Force  as well as Soviet collective farm machinery  causing possible widespread famine and even the collapse of the Soviet Union: ""Dependence on oil supplies from the Caucasus is the fundamental weakness of Russian economy. The Armed Forces were totally dependent on this source also for their motorized agriculture. More than 90% of oil extraction and 80% of refinement was located in the Caucasus (primarily Baku). Therefore  interruption of oil supplies on any large scale would have far-reaching consequences and could even result in the collapse of all the military  industrial and agricultural systems of Russia.""  IMO  this would have also been Germany's best shot at taking out The USSR at the start of Barbarossa. Hitlers folly up intill and including Stalingrad ( where he broke off 25% of Stalingrads starting attacking force to try and take Baku intact  rather than get Stalingrad over with quickly  then and only then mop up Baku after cutting them off) was Germany didn't need ANY extra oil for themselfs if the USSR also wasn't producing very much.    If German stratagy from the start  The Germans would have needed to conquer at least 200-300 miles into the Ukraine to set up airfields with the bombers capable of reaching Baku round trip (range at the time). If planned better they could have also maybe sent in 25 000 men in gliders on a one way suicide/sabatoge mission to Baku instead of wasting them on Crete. Once the Germans started landing the Russians may have even sabotaged all their own oil producing apparatus for them. Once destroyed  needing to invade deep in the USSR may have been unnessessaraly for their surrender.   "

You're not going to find much in (actual  not Dark Enlightenment edgelords) reactionary thought about creating ethnically pure classless societies unified by a totalitarian state. There's a reason it was a coalition of monarchists who tried to assassinate Hitler.

Hitler did promote the concept of German superiority. He genuinely wanted the Slavic people exterminated  and was not actually interested in the Jewish people ""peacefully"" moving to Palestine. During the Second World War  some Zionist leaders tried to negotiate with the Nazis for simply moving the Jewish to Palestine rather than putting them in Ghetto. The proposal went nowhere."

lordrosco0826,UkrainianConflict,2015-03-17 9:29,Your not the only one out there NewKidAround. Many of us who have brains are pro-ukraine. Its obvious what Russia is doing. When the people of Ukraine ousted Viktor Yanukovych Russia saw its hopefull Eurasian Economic block and Russia's grip on the navel port Sevastopol in danger. Russia refuses to recognize Ukraine's right to self determination and to join the EU. Joining the EU did not mean joining NATO. I understand Russia's concerns over the expansion of NATO. NATO was created to counter the USSR and therefore Russia to. The thing the world needs to understand is that if we allow Putin to annex territory of a country he will not stop at Ukraine. Appeasing Putin would result in the same disaster that resulted in appeasing Hitler. I'm not saying Putin is Hitler I dont believe he wants to commit ethnic genocide. What I'm saying is that there are similarities between Nazi Germany and current Russia. Putin has consolidated power to a point that there are no other voices but his own. Just like in Nazi Germany Russian people are being intimidated from voicing any decent. Nationalist groups like the Cossacks and the Night Wolves are making sure of that with there anti-maiden rhetoric. In the end Russia will only suffer. They have lost the trust of the world. It will take years to undo the damage that Putin has done to his country. Cut Russia from SWIFT let him now the west is not going to stand by and allow Putin to go unpunished. 
Reza2015,PersianHistory,2015-03-17 9:31,That is indeed friendly to Hitler.   Hitler before the Wannsee conference wanted the European Jews out of Germany and appealed to many countries to help (the Western countries refused). Iranian-Germans were exempt from the  Nuremberg laws and Iran was invaded by the Soviets and British due to Iran assisting German nationals within Iran.

PieMaster64,hockey,2015-03-17 9:46,My recommendation for when you visit Ottawa is to stay as close to downtown as you can and then bus out to the game. The arena is around a 25-30 minute drive in no traffic from downtown and there really isn't anything to do in the surrounding area. I know that [The Senate Sports Tavern](http://www.thesenate.ca/) in the ByWard Market offers a shuttle bus to and from the game for 5$ you just have to call ahead and reserve a seat.   For dinner the ByWard Market has lots of great restaurants and bars. [Check this list out for suggestions.](http://www.byward-market.com/directory/restaurants.htm)   For drinks you could either stay in the ByWard Market or head over to Elgin St. and Bank St. just south of the highway. They have bars aplenty you really can't miss. (Elgin St. is where our 'Sens Mile' was during our Stanley Cup run where we poured out of the bars afterwards and partied in the streets. It's only like this during playoffs though.)  For things to do checking out Parliament Hill and the surrounding downtown core (Canadian War Memorial National Art Gallery and Sparks St. is a great late night walk). Since Ottawa is the capital city most of the great museums are here and they're a must. I'd recommend one or all of the National Art Gallery Canadian Museum of Nature the Museum of Civilization just over the bridge in Quebec and Canadian War Museum (they have all sorts of war memorabilia and vehicles including one of Hitler's cars bullet holes and all!)  If you're the kind of person that likes a late night 'after drinks' munchie you can't get much better/local than a shawarma. Castle Shawarma on Rideau St. is usually considered the best and is my favourite but I'll let other Ottawa natives suggest others as there are too many shawarma shops downtown to count on two hands.  Anyways let me know if there's anything else you want to know whether it be in the city or at the arena itself!

finjeta,russia,2015-03-17 9:50,"I didn't say finland won we didn't.      ""why would you destroy something you'd want to take for yourself?"" Because it's easier to take something when you don't have to make your way trough fortified positions when attacking. Why would they have even wanted those defences since if they had taken whole of finland then they had fought germans in the lapland. And comparing war to peacfull annexion wouldn't be fair we could instead compare it to chechen wars. There were heavy damages to local buildings and as such I doupt the damage would too different to what the other wars were.      ""There would be no reason to conquer it if it succeeded"" How do you plan on placing a puppet government in Helsinki without invading it first. Stalin abandoned the puppet governemnt after the war was over because they couldn't be placed to lead finland.      Sure USSR could have taken finland if they had continued their offence for few weeks to take Viipuri and then another 2-6 weeks for rest of the country but the reason Stalin wanted to end the war was because he wanted the embaresing war to end quickly it's good to note that Soviet Union deployed 1/4 of their entire active military to finnish front and had barely advanced what they were suposed to have by the day 7. Second reason for Stalin wanting to end the war was because he knew that if France and UK would see Soviet union as an enemy he would have hard time getting them to help him against Hitler instead of them just minding their own fronts."

Anacarbo,podemos,2015-03-17 9:53,Cada año leemos cuántas mujeres han sido asesinadas por sus parejas masculinas y obviamos los casos contrarios. Que los homosexuales y las lesbianas se maten no importa porque el régimen feminista realmente no intenta salvar a nadie sino enfrentar a los dos géneros. Pero hablando estrictamente el Sistema no oculta las muertes de ellos. Realmente y por mor de la terminología los hombres muertos por violencia de género no existen. La Ley Integral diseñada como las normas hitlerianas solamente para una parte de la población discrimina entre asesinados: sólo les otorga el paraguas del género a las mujeres muertas por sus parejas. Una chica a la que un extraño someta a un crimen machista tan repugnante como una violación no es víctima de violencia de género. Los niños muertos por sus padres tampoco cuentan en las estadísticas que determinan cómo se reparten el dinero las asociaciones feministas que cobran por número de denuncias conseguidas lo que convierte el lenguaje en dinero. En cuanto a los asesinatos de hombres el Sistema maquilla lingüísticamente hasta sus cadáveres. Al varón asesinado por su mujer le aplica la frase condenatoria algo habrá hecho la misma que utilizaba el franquismo con las asesinadas en un nuevo paralelismo entre feminismo y machismo.  La neolengua de Orwell en la España de 2012. Las cifras de suicidas masculinos se dispararon en España desde que en 2005 se popularizó el café para todas de los divorcios por la vía penal que arruinan a la mayoría de los hombres y llevan a la cárcel a un número de inocentes que nunca conoceremos. En 2006 el dato del estado civil desapareció de las estadísticas así que los hombres en trámites de separación que se quitaban la vida se evaporaron. Stalin borró de las fotos oficiales a un Trotsky caído en desgracia que pasó a nunca haber existido pero en esta ocasión eso les ha ocurrido a muchos miles de personas y teóricamente en una democracia. También borró realidades la neolengua de la novela 1984 de Orwell con la que un gobierno totalitario retorcía las palabras basándose en que lo que no forma parte de la lengua no puede ser pensado.

InfoTroll4Hire,Documentaries,2015-03-17 9:54,Your welcome Lenin Jr. Report all you want you national socialist Nazi. why don't you record my whole post on ELS so that the brain-dead mods that lurk there can get an education.   I noticed they don't even like the history that isn't controversial. Your sub is populated by some real dummies:  &gt &gt VoteRonaldRayGun 1 point 1 day ago   &gt &gt Wait wait wait... so German Imperialists who started WWI destroying Germany's assets is somehow communism's fault?  &gt Me:  &gt A major cause of WW1 was resentment towards Germany because they were a rising export superpower in Europe and rivalry with Russia after the Bolshevik revolution. Jewish Bolsheviks killed well over 20million people during the communist revolutions of the early 1900s-1917 (Lenin was also a Jew and a communist as was Trotsky who was living in NY prior to the communist revolution in Russia which was financed by Wall St. [Jacob Schiff provided the Bolsheviks with an estimated $20million in gold] 85% of the Bolsheviks were Jews and anyone who opposed them was either executed or thrown into a gulag forced labor camp to die). Germany was allied with Austria-Hungary whose Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbia which was allied with Russia (because they resented Austria-Hungary's absorption of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 when the Ottoman Empire's control of the Balkans collapsed that was home to a substantial Serb population) which started the war (in the Corfu Declaration in 1917 the Serbian government officially declared its intention to form a state of Yugoslavia). The European Allied countries (mainly Britain) responded to Germany's defense of Austria-Hungary with a blockade of Germany from 1914-1919. France declared war on Germany after Germany declared war on Russia after Russia invaded east Prussia. Germany invaded Belgium (allied with Britain) after they refused them safe passage. By 1916 not a single shot had been fired on German soil but France and Britain were devastated. Germany offered peace terms to let everything be as it was before the war with no changes in territory.  &gt Let's not forget that the Bolsheviks succeeded in destroying Germany in WW2 and dividing it along the Berlin Wall dubbed the Iron Curtain by Winston Churchill. As soon as Hitler was removed east Germany fell under Soviet control.  [deleted]  You people are pathetic can't even hold a decent argument so can only attempt to suppress contradicting information. No wonder you all hate free speech.  I await for ELS to launch their Jihad against Winston Churchill who called the Jews nothing less than traitors to all their host countries and plead with them to change their treasonous ways:   &gt Winston Churchill published an article in the Illustrated Sunday Herald on this date in 1920 titled “Zionism versus Bolshevism” in which he called upon the Jews a “people of peculiar genius” **to opt for being “national Jews” not “international Jews” i.e. communists — “world-wide conspirators for the overthrow of civilization** and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality.” “The conflict between good and evil which proceeds unceasingly in the breast of man” wrote Churchill “nowhere reaches such an intensity as in the Jewish race. The dual nature of mankind is nowhere more strongly or more terribly exemplified. We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind . . . And it may well be that this same astounding race may at the present time be in the actual process of producing another system of morals and philosophy as malevolent as Christianity was benevolent which if not arrested would shatter irretrievably all that Christianity has rendered possible. It would almost seem as if the gospel of Christ and the gospel of Antichrist were destined to originate among the same people  and that this mystic and mysterious race had been chosen for the supreme manifestations both of the divine and the diabolical.”  &gt “The struggle which is now beginning between the Zionist and Bolshevik Jews is little less than a struggle for the soul of the Jewish people.” —Winston Churchill  ................. &gt http://www.fpp.co.uk/bookchapters/WSC/WSCwrote1920.html &gt International Jews  &gt In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most if not all of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx and down to Trotsky (Russia) Bela Kun (Hungary) Rosa Luxembourg (Germany) and Emma Goldman (United States) this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality has been steadily growing. It played as a modern writer Mrs. Webster has so ably shown a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century  and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.  &gt Terrorist Jews  &gt There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews it is certainly a very great one  it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin a pure Russian is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky or of Zinovieff the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd) or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent if not indeed the principal part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria) so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing.

CantStopWhitey,MorbidReality,2015-03-17 10:03,"I am and am surprised.  Thank you.  I will explain how we differ and how we agree.  First everything we are about to discuss is serious horrific atrocities.  Please don't misunderstand my stance on that. Sldo I'll try to cram it all into a nutshell as I doubt you'll respond further. Now to the differences.  As for the Jews was actually closer to around 3 million jews who died.   It was not a ""systemic extermination"".  They were most definitely put into concentration camps but the ovens are myths.  The gassings by Zyklon B are myths.  It has been proven that it was simply impossible to burn all of the bodies with the crematoriums they had at their disposal.  The Zyklon B was indeed for delousing not used for gassing people because there simply were no airtight rooms found in any of the camps.  (That surprised me very much as well at first!)    So how did 3 million so die? The concentration camps were still full near the end of the war.  Rampant diseases swept through the camps killing most and the others died of famine as German supply lines were cut of by Allied bombings.  Did you know that there is not one single document by any of yhe top German officials including Hitler himself calling for the execution of those in the camps?  Weird right?  Go to /r/history and ask them just about this last fact and they will ban you outright.  Try it if you don't believe me. "

RazDwaTrzy,europe,2015-03-17 10:10,"Frankly speaking nothing comes to my mind in terms of what communists could take from Hitler.  Since the end of the 'Great War' they'd been doing 'pretty well' with building machine of death on their own.  GULAG Cheka cult of Lenin Comintern terror - these had been parts of the system long before Hitler became strong enough to influence on Germany.  After Lenin's death in 1924 Stalin took the power and inherited popularity of his predecessor which from that point was raising very fast. With fear altogether.  One fine thing has just came to my mind which may describe differences and independence in ""thinking"" between those two systems - technology:  Hitler crossed the 'space border' with V2 rocket.  Stalin built White Sea–Baltic Canal with bare hands in record time of 3 years. It's the longest canal in the world and the most useless one as well. Technology used to build the canal was taken directly from middle-age period. Wood and blood."

I am not sure if I'd have released every political prisoner on Earth even if it was in my power so no. I would not kill a horse for that.  3. Hitler's skull that would be the most impressive thing in my whole house hell I'd pay for that thing and I bet many many people would pay me just to visit my house and see it for themselves.   4. No I would not swallow the pill.   5. Probably yes the embarrassment would be way less embarrassing than the awesomeness of watching my dreams.   6. The president's cancer for sure I think there are way more impressive creatures than Nessie or Bigfoot already. Even if they are real president having cancer is a thing that shakes the economy way more. Look at Tardigrades very  impressive creatures yet most don't even know they exist.  7.  I hate puppets I wouldn't even think of marrying that person.  8.  I would find it intriguing and I definitely would have to read it. So yes increase.  9.  I am a special effects nerd  I don't believe in this type of mystical stuff so yes I would stay and watch the movie.  10. Nothing or everything honestly  it would be kind of hard decision to make. Would have to witness it.  11. You specified that they can read not that they can understand. I do not know the capabilities of cat's brain but they are definitely limited.  12. Explaining to everyone why I had chosen not to undergo the operation? Seriously this would drastically change who I am not going through that.   13. I am already in Europe. Definitely moon can make a lot of money of off the things I collect can go there and video tape myself on the moon and other cool stuff. Would make enough money for year in the US. :P   14.  Wouldn't that kill them too though? I tripped while approaching him and when falling onto the ground my leg hit his chest? Seems perfectly reasonable to me.  15.  The second one.

It's good storytelling and i see why redditor love it but it's far away from any truth.  The french revolution wasn't an ""every brake is broken"" moment. At first the revolutionary wanted to keep the king in place just with a limitation of power. It's because the king didn't respect his part of the deal several times he was executed. He was vetoing constantly bills voted by the parliament he tried to ally himself with other european monarchs against France. The royalty was not discarded at all and the French people still had a lot of respect for their king. Even after the betrayal of the king there was still a lot of debat in the parliament to see if they should kill the king or not.  The revolution was also preceeded by the ""Etats géneraux"" were all the population said what they had to say to the king.   Of course the revolution had its dark times but it was not as simplist as you make it sounds.  And you also forgot entirely that particularly in the 20th and now 21st century a lot of time it's conservatives who had extreme attemps to make the society as they wishes it was. Like hitler or mussolini. They were not only ""moderating the march of  pogress"". And if we take hitler point of view what he was doing was progress. Progress to a more conservative society.  You can make anything under the term progressive and conservative. If you are in a perfect equalitarian free democracy and someone wants to change it to more inequality and less liberty that is so called ""progressive"" who will surely be the conservative and will want to spot the modification of the society."

Your position of ""every conservative ideal about economics"" being wrong is obviously false.

nathanmasse,TimeTravelWhatIf,2015-03-17 10:55,Well I assume you're also implying that the population infrastructure and military equipment are also transfers back in time.    There are two scenarios: 1) Germany realizes they've been sent back immediately (without launching the invasion of Poland) and 2) They are unaware and invade Poland assuming they're still in 1939. Honestly I don’t think that we need to delve into the specifics of each example because in either event Germany would eventually realize something had happened as they blitz across Poland and find none of the resistance they expected or just when the Germany population tunes in with their radios and find that almost none of the non-German stations are active. Either way within a matter of days Germany has realized it’s in 1919.  Regardless of which scenario is the case there are a few facts we can establish: 1) Germany is the most technologically advanced nation on the planet by far  2) Germany is the most populous *stable* country in Europe twice the population of France or UK at the time  and 3) The rest of Europe is still devastated from the Great War and would be in no position to (truly) resist in any capacity.  I honestly can’t think of what would make Hitler happier at this point in his life than to be in 1919 and see the looks on the diplomats’ faces as he explains what the Treaty of Versailles (which they just passed two months ago) had done and how he and still managed to make Germany the 1939 juggernaut it would appear to be.  Obviously he would embellish the story and whatnot but that’s neither here nor there.  It would be simple enough for Hitler to demonstrate the force at his disposal by launching a coordinated air attack on Paris (or London!) or simple sending his wolfpacks out and putting the UK in a stranglehold.  He may simply decide (since he is staunchly anti-communist to nip the Bolshevik Movement in the butt and successfully occupy Western Russia. No matter how he shows it Germany would become the dominant force in Europe without a doubt but that’s just Europe.   The US has risen from the ashes of the Great War relatively unscathed and if anything far more powerful.  In just a few months they had learned many of the tricks and tactics it had taken the European countries years and millions of men to develop. The country had been pulled from a recession and was now boom quite nicely.  But they would most certainly see Germany for what it was the greatest threat to America that had ever surfaced.  Not the kind of threat that Japan was (“oh dear they might take some of our islands”) but a true existential thread.   And then there’s Japan who also rose from the ashes of the Great War with nothing but good things to say about it.  They are isolated enough from Europe and America that I don’t expect their behavior to change drastically from our current time with the possible exception that they may grab some French and UK territories sooner.  The only way I could see Japan being a deciding factor in this future is if they ally themselves with one of the other powers.    In our timeline the US in the 1920’s really doesn’t consider military advancement a priority.  They had just helped in ‘The War to End All Wars’ so why invest in better tank designs or more powerful aircraft engines when the ones you have work just fine in peacetime?  Well in this new timeline the US is under no illusions that there will be another war  Germany’s throwing its weight around and stomping out any resistance to their dominance of Europe and the US would be able to tell that it was only a matter of time until Germany decided Europe was big enough and wanted to hop across the pond. A fierce self-reliant militarism would crop up in the US (likely lead by Theodor Roosevelt) and rather than being isolationist it would be defencivist. It would seem likely that with the proper coxing and possible a few stolen technologies from Germany that they could reach 1941 military potential by the end of 1930.  Meanwhile Germany would be basking in their superiority (both militarily and perceived racially) and I would expect their military and scientific industry to flounder somewhat.  It’s human nature to work more slowly when there’s less external pressure and to work at a feverish pace when your life is in the balance.   As a result I would estimate that the US and Germany would likely develop nuclear capability with a few years (1935-1939) of each other and for there to be a three-way cold war between Japan the US and Germany.  Japan would develop nukes later presumably in the 1950's after it has consolidated its hold of China Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.  From there I can’t say any number of things could happen and diplomatic standoffs between three powers are likely to be more volatile than when it’s just two.   
txstoploss,europe,2015-03-17 10:56,Wow 25 whole years of 'independence' for Russia's thousand-year-old front doormat. The one that broke Napoleon and Hitler  no Russia would *willingly* let that go the minute mighty NATO barks.
JDHoare,socialism,2015-03-17 10:56,"&gt Further how exactly can Fascism be derived from Communism?  They're correct to the extent that fascism - and national socialism - cherrypicked from earlier radical left creeds although not Communism specifically. Although they're more firmly rooted in the right it's this lingering influence that acts as a flimsy screed for Fox News commentators to claim Hitler was a socialist or Obama is a Nazi or whatever it is they're doing this week. (The truth just in case there's any doubt is that both fascism and national socialism are right wing political ideologies with some populist left-wing elements)  Mussolini's politics for example developed as a member of the Italian Socialist Party (where he edited papers like The Future of the Worker and Class Struggle) and the word ""fascism"" comes from Fascio - a bundle or sheath - which was a name applied to literally any political grouping in early 20th Century Italy.   His personal politics were rooted in the radical left - he was a republican and referred to priests as ""black germs."" World War I changed all that as it did for many leftists in mainland Europe.  &gt In addition Nazism isn't derived from Fascism it's a particular ""brand"" of fascism that developed in Germany in the 1930's  Nazism is a brand of lower-case fascism but it's fair to say that it's - much like say Peronism or Falangism - derived from Italian Fascism which is an ideology in itself."
HeimerdingerLiberal,canada,2015-03-17 10:56,I didn't ask what Hitler demanded from the German people in 1933. 
imdep,AskReddit,2015-03-17 10:57,Yes Hitler Stalin Osama bin Laden... you get the picture. Unfortunately the people who should hate themselves never will.

OKCupid_Adventure,OkCupid,2015-03-17 11:07,"&gt  Okay this was kind of a jerk message upon reflection.  It really isn't though. If I had a time machine one of the first things I would do is go back to teenage me slap myself **REALLY** hard upside the fucking head and say ""Get over yourself dickhead! The word 'no' is ***NOT*** LETHAL!""  Then I'd go punch Hitler. That's how we know time travel is impossible. There was never a line of weirdly dressed dudes waiting to punch Hitler."

SonnyBlack90,todayilearned,2015-03-17 11:08,There is literally no time in history when a man with Hitler's personality and demeanor wouldn't have been extremely desirable to women. Some people just have very special skills socially and he was one of them. The opposite of us Redditors.

SpongeBobMadeMeGay,worldnews,2015-03-17 11:11,Before the Armageddon Jesus freaks call for nuclear war we need to take a step back and look at this situation objectively.   By even the most conservative estimates the vast majority of Crimean people want to join Russia. Russia fucked up when they sent in way way too many troops and weapons beyond what what needed to keep the basic government running. Russia definitely fueled violent conflict and annexed a sovereign country and for that putin deserves to pay the price. But this is no Hitler's Poland. There was a mostly legit democratic process in the midst of a revolutionary coup with a number of serious Russian assets at risk in the area. US would have probably acted similarly if British Columbia plunged into chaos.  **tl dr** everyone calm the fuck down before you get us all evaporated. 
AnimusNoctis,AskReddit,2015-03-17 11:11,Where does Hitler keep his armies?  Poland.

MormonMoron,latterdaysaints,2015-03-17 11:17,Exactly. The approach taken by Reform Mormonism is the exact opposite end of the spectrum from violent fundamentalists. The one side justifies sin because they believe it a mandate from God while the other justifies sin because they argue they get to define what is wrong.  Both extremes are damaging. Maybe I shouldn't have used violent examples (like Hitler) to make the point because as you have correctly pointed out that most violent justifications have come from religious zealots. However I would argue that the more insidious personally destructive sins are justified by the kind of thinking promoted by Reform Mormonism.
joe_canadian,CanadaPolitics,2015-03-17 11:18,&gt But look what happens when one gets away... Canadians suddenly discover what sort of people are running the country.  Yes because one backbencher who's known for saying stupid things ([e.g. this Godwin's Law](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/02/10/canadian_tory_mp_larry_miller_says_liberal_longgun_registry_is_hitlerian.html)) represents another 165 people. I think that statement would make more sense if it was a plank of party policy or came down from leadership.

Psy1,UkrainianConflict,2015-03-17 11:20,&gt  I really think that the Russians aren’t the ones to lecture Ukraine and Ukrainians about fascism especially since they were the ones that signed the pact with the devil [Nazi Germany] and started World War II  The Molotov-Riptoven pact came as a reaction to the Munich agreement where the USSR was starting to worry France and Britain would sit and do nothing as Germany expanded eastward towards the USSR even if Germany expanded into the USSR.  The point of Molotov-Riptoven was to force Hitler to expand east into France so no mater what France and Britain would be forced to side against Hitler.   Stalin intended to break Molotov-Riptoven but didn't expect France to be defeated so quickly also records showed that Britain and France had no intention of defending Poland thus the Phoney War stage of WWII were France and Britain declared on Germany but neither launched any offensive against Germany as their long standing war plans going back to the 1920's were for them to wait for Germany to invade Belgium or France and their Generals always intended to let Germany push as far east as he wished.
