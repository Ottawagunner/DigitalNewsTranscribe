readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland  although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful  they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation  the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed  they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)   it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.
KozakJ,UkrainianConflict,2015-03-17 12:07,"Nonsense. Mozgovoi uses some populist rhetoric  but he fights to establish the pre-1917  tsarist ""Novorossiya"" as part of ""Russki Mir"". I don't know how you define 'socialism'  'anarchism' or 'radical left'  but not even the most flexible Stalinist ideological contortions could squeeze that into a left revolutionary model. "
thrasumachos,MapPorn,2015-03-17 12:09,As oppressive as Putin is  he has nothing on Stalin. He's a Soviet wannabe.
matts2,PoliticalDiscussion,2015-03-17 12:09,The Soviets had it double. There was no inherent system to transfer information and there was great incentive to lie. The Stalin system punished failure with death  the following system was not as bad but still encouraged dishonesty. It would have been far better without that  but still would have fallen short.
scottb84,CanadaPolitics,2015-03-17 12:10,"Nobody is denying the brutality of life under Stalinist rule.   But rare indeed will be the Canadian whose family tree hasn't brushed up against brutality or suffering of some kind. Ours is a settler society. Were everything hunky dory in the old country  its likely that many of our forefathers wouldn't have chosen to transplant themselves to what not so long ago was a harsh and uncivilized hinterland.   Unfortunately  the physical space around our important capital institutions simply isn't large enough to accommodate a memorial to every injustice or tragedy that's befallen humanity. The decision to single out one persecuted group for a memorial [""nearly equal in size to the War Memorial plaza on Elgin  and almost three times the size of the Peacekeeping Memorial on Sussex""](http://spacing.ca/ottawa/2015/03/13/12884/) is arbitrary and betrays our obligation to curate this space in the interests of all Canadians.

monsata,politics,2015-03-17 12:12,Stalin also likely would have set the lawn on fire as punishment and shot the homeowner for letting it grow.
overyonder21,HistoryWhatIf,2015-03-17 12:20,I haven't read the Khrushchev book  but I would place more blame onto Mao.  Khrushchev at least extended an invitation to Mao to travel to Russia and talk.  Mao's the one who screwed it up just because he couldn't accept Khrushchev criticizing Stalin's policies.    Mao's ego was so incredibly large that no one could penetrate it. Although he had been trying to have China stray away Stalin's policies (he would repeatedly say that Stalin policies gave the foundation  but the Chinese people must forge their own path)  he still believed in them. Mao's words contradicted his actions numerous times throughout his life.  He is the reason why China was so fucked during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and is still having issues today.  
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:26,"The parts of Germany gave to Poland was compensation demanded by the Western Allies for taking easter territories of Poland. Today's Kaliningrad Oblast' was to be part of Poland aswell (with the city of Kaliningrad bearing name Królewiec) although Stalin changed his mind in the last moment and decided to add this territory to the RSFSR. Lwów which is considered to be the one of the two main (along with Kraków) cities where the Polish elite was being raised has been given to the Ukrainian SSR as it had claim on it and meant that one of the very important places where the polish patriotism could be continiued ceased to exist.  The case of Baltics while might seem complicated was pretty simple. The countries had fairy low population and even though each of them had very different culture with and unlike Ukraine/Belarus had nothing in common with Russia  they couldn't pose any real threat. The USSR also played the ""better safe than sorry card"" and made the Baltic States a place where Soviet Army officers were sent for retirement. This resulted in fairly large russian minority being still present in these countries today. Stalin did almost the same thing with Crimea  although he took a step further there and instead of only moving russian citizens there  he expelled most of the Tatar people from there to Siberia in fear of organized resistance (as the Tatar community  much like the Poles are known for their ferocity in fights against opressors).  As for the Chechens i fear that although I know a bit of their cause  my knowledge is not sufficent to provide you a quality answer. I can only guess that they underestimated them and it serves them right to this day since they have constant insurgency in that area."

my_baby_ate_dingos,france,2015-03-17 12:59,J'ai en effet souvent dans l'idée qu'une 2e guerre mondiale finie en 1940 se solde invariablement par une guerre froide qui évolue en 3e guerre mondiale. Industrialisée  militarisée  avec Staline à sa tête  l'URSS était l'ennemi naturel de l'Europe de l'Est.  Sans alliance Allemagne-Japon  Roosevelt n'a aucune excuse pour pousser à une stricte alliance militaire avec la France et le Royaume-Uni après Pearl Harbor. Les US se lancent donc dans une guerre bilatérale contre le Japon. L'Europe de l'Est est libérée du Reich par les Occidentaux et non par les Rouges  donc pas de pacte de Varsovie.   Seulement  y'a encore des troupes russes en Pologne  et je pense pas que Staline aurait lâché ses gains territoriaux suite à l'invasion de 39 une fois l'Allemagne écroulée.  Avec Daladier et Chamberlain encore à la tête de la France et le Royaume-Uni  le pacifisme européen est encore vivace  mais sous cinq à dix ans la question polonaise finirait par relancer les machines de guerre. Surtout si les US finissent par battre le Japon (avec ou sans l'arme nucléaire  d'ailleurs) et menacent l'URSS à l'est.  Ca serait comme toute guerre au sol contre la Russie  une boucherie...

ALittleBitOfHate,russia,2015-03-17 13:16,"  I'm sure your Russian friends will respect you dearly if you explain to them how subhuman they are compared to you.  Why are you so full of hatred?   Another stupid propaganda. It's not propagande it's a fact. Stallin got 100000 troops that were only responsible of getting anything of value from conquered territories  and geeting them on trains to Russia. Factories  trains  art  everything. There are Stalins orders as a proof  plus Russian Duma addmited it in 1998.  I will give you just one figure: 5500 kms of railway track were stolen from Poland  and transported to Russia.   One incident is now considered the same as holocaust....O.K.  It's not a singl accident. I just gave you an example. Stalin killed more people than Hitler.   Yes  you should be grateful for having a good standard of living  Good standard of living? Are you kidding me? Was there a single communist country with the good standard of living?    More bullshit propaganda. They didn't lose anything  get out of your bubble.  So what was the reason that USSR collapsed  and Warsaw Pact ceased to exist?   Calling bigots like you ""fucks"" is not phobia.  You are truly amazing.   You'd know that if your government didn't do such a perfect brainwashing job on you.

YRM_DM,Christianity,2015-03-17 13:26,"Maybe we're just using different terms.  Religious freedom is a positive thing that makes progress possible.  When Religious freedom is not possible... either through things like atheist Stalin  or cult-like Hitler  or in the Salem Witch Trials  or in Sharia Law states today  or in the days of the Inquisition.   That is when progress suffers.  And I am 100% for religious freedom.  If someone ever tried to pass a law saying you couldn't go to church  pray with family and friends  worship in your home  etc.  I'd be right there with you protesting.  I may not think it's truth  but  you have every right to believe what you want.   We live in a great country where debate is possible.  What I'm trying to say is that  when strongly religious people get power and try to enforce their strictest morality in law... like  in Afghanistian where the Taliban were executing homosexuals in soccer stadiums.   Or during the dark ages...  or in Salem during the witch trials.  People are shut down.  Progress is halted.  It can be anyone shutting this down  as long as they are a fervent believer in whatever...   Kim Jong Il thinks he's a god  so he dominates all other religion out of his culture and promoted myth about himself.  Freedom    non-freedom  It doesn't really matter what the belief systems are  within that freedom... as has been pointed out  when Islam was less radical  they were at the leading edge of technology and progress in the world.   It's not because Islam is ""true"" but because they allowed for more religious freedoms at that time."
VelveteenAmbush,news,2015-03-17 13:30,Yep  Stalin is just like someone who dares not to wear clothing inside of his own home. Exactly the same.

sycamoretree651,AskReddit,2015-03-17 13:31,I think every person who believes there is a hell for non-believers  should spend every second of their lives trying to convert people to their religion.

G3nji_17,BokuNoHeroAcademia,2015-03-17 13:54,I have some criticism for the quiz  first of you should say the full name of students or at least the names that are primarily used in the manga. Saying just somebody's first name when litterally everyone refers to them with their last name is not nice. It could make for some interesting questions of itself thought  something like what is Izukus last name or somebody else.  Secondly I don't think the questions about the subreddit or podcasts are that great in a quiz about the manga  I honestly was expecting to be quizzed about the manga and not this subreddit.  Thrid while the best girl question was quite funny and I am aware it is only worth 1 point I actually like the idea you had in your response to /u/Joseph_Stalin_ a lot more  the winner of the quiz can pick a character that the last question will be about.  So far to the questions themself. Now general form.   The timer was way to harsh  there is no indication that there will be a timer at the beginning and since the site was beeing really really slow I spend about half of my quiz time waiting for the site to load the next question. This could be solved by just giving the players the last page where you can check your answers right away.  You should provide more info at the beginning of the quiz  usually people do the quiz and then check the comments after to avoid spoilers so providing info in the comments doesn't really work.  I also really liked the Lunch-Rush question with the picture. I think doing more things with the pictures would be great.  Thank you for spending you time doing this :) It would be really awesome if this got to be a regular and popular thing and I hope my feedback helps you improve it.
Renard4,france,2015-03-17 13:59,  Bien sûr que quand ils ont brisé l'entente qu'ils avait avec les russes en les attaquant c'était une connerie monumentale  Alors ça c'est la seconde guerre mondiale  c'est le pacte Ribbentrop-Molotov ou pacte germano-soviétique.

Adahn5,CommunismWorldwide,2015-03-17 14:01,"  I'm going to mostly ignore this silly accusation  Gee... thanks Solid. Bloody hell  I really don't know what to say about all this if you genuinely believe Anarchists to be reactionaries. I don't know if this is a recent development of yours or if someone beat you with an 1800s stick over the head  but this is a side of you I've never seen before.   It would naturally lead to anarchy  not communism  I think we would all benefit from understand what *you* consider to be Anarchism then. Please explain what you know of it  because this might be the key to understanding your misunderstandings.   there will always be people telling other people how to do things.  And that's not something Anarchists necessarily oppose. In Bakunin's 'What is Authority' he clearly says so:    Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots  I refer to the authority of the bootmaker  concerning houses  canals  or railroads  I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence  their character  their knowledge  reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch  I consult several  I compare their opinions  and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority  even in special questions  consequently  whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual  I have no absolute faith in any person. Such a faith would be fatal to my reason  to my liberty  and even to the success of my undertakings  it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave  an instrument of the will and interests of others.    If I bow before the authority of the specialists and avow my readiness to follow  to a certain extent and as long as may seem to me necessary  their indications and even their directions  it is because their authority is imposed on me by no one  neither by men nor by God. ions and even their directions Otherwise I would repel them with horror  and bid the devil take their counsels  their directions  and their services  certain that they would make me pay  by the loss of my liberty and self-respect  for such scraps of truth  wrapped in a multitude of lies  as they might give me.    I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason. I am conscious of my own inability to grasp  in all its detail  and positive development  any very large portion of human knowledge. The greatest intelligence would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole. Thence results  for science as well as for industry  the necessity of the division and association of labour. I receive and I give - such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn. **Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority  but a continual exchange of mutual  temporary  and  above all  voluntary authority and subbordination**.  So yeah  there might be someone calling the shots  but we should be able to decide democratically on who those leaders should be  and be able to jettison them if they prove themselves unworthy of that position of service and authority.   The reason we call Stalin's USSR and Mao's China 'communist' is because they were trying build communism. Not because they called themselves communists.  Then following the logical conclusion to that argument you should call Anarchists communists because they're trying to build Communism  as they did with the Paris Commune  as they did in Revolutionary Catalonia  Kim Jwa Jin in Korea  and the free territories in Ukraine 1918 and Hungary in 1956  as they are in my country right here in Mexico in Chiapas currently.   ""We believe that the Anarchists are real enemies of Marxism"" and so do I.  So you would perpetuate another Kronstadt  then? Because Anarchists are the enemies of Marxism  Solid? Is that truly and honestly what you seek?"

Batyrsik,russia,2015-03-17 14:07,Sorry  you're wrong here. The Soviets successfully broke the Mannerheim line in the middle of February 1940  in no small part due to Stalin replacing the incompetent Voroshilov with the competent Timoshenko. The Finns were pushed back to Viipuri  and their army was running very low on ammo and other supplies. The Soviets had every means to push their victory even further when the peace treaty was signed.

--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,badphilosophy,2015-03-17 14:48," I don't know if nuclear annihilation is in our future but no way is that risk higher than it was during the cold war.  On the one hand  that's true. On the other hand  it's also not exactly my point. We've been lucky  and so it hasn't happened yet. But there is a non-negligible chance of global nuclear war breaking out  it would absolutely fuck over Pinker's neat little graphs if it did  and he doesn't really have any good reasons that it won't.   Here is my problem with your criticism of what violence is. Pinker's usage allows you to pick random people across time and ask will they die a violent death resulting from another man's intent to kill? You then end up with a clear result saying that modern humans are less likely to die that way. Now if we try to incorporate your criticisms  what do we do now?  For one thing  Pinker needs to be consistent. From page 67 that I linked before     Pinker himself doesn’t believe it  as he and his sources violate it whenever they deal with communist regimes. For these regimes (e.g.  Stalin  Mao  and Pol Pot)  attributing indirect  non-combat- related deaths to a deliberate plan requires no imaginative leap at all—the communists are maximally guilty for all of them  and estimating deaths poses no methodological problems.   Well you are less likely to die that violent death  I don't necessarily think that's true. Beginning with ""Massaging the Numbers"" on page 69  the linked text discusses Pinker's dishonest or shoddy use of good sources (his deliberate use of bad sources is discussed earlier)  and the upshot of it all is that it doesn't seem clear that history exhibits the sort of progression Pinker thinks it does.   Thus while a certain “logic of violence” may be natural to human life at an interpersonal level  there is no evidence that violence and war were central to the development of humans for the first 95 percent of the past 200 000 years—or any time before.   How do you work through this ambiguity to get a quantitative result?  I don't think you can. I also don't necessarily think it's necessary to do so.   What is the violence that you are claiming is resulting from globalization?  Globalization  aggressive modernization  universalizing capitalism. Not just globalization. Just to give a very quick list  I think the Korean War  Vietnam  Iraq  and Afghanistan are excellent examples. As for other  more nebulous forms of violence  I certainly think it's fair to include preventable starvation  preventable disease  and exploitation of 3rd-world workers under the heading of violence. They certainly seem to give lie to the ""look how great humanity is becoming"" thesis."

Batyrsik,russia,2015-03-17 15:20,Yes  I think Stalin knew this. When your army goes from incurring heavy casualties to breaking through and trouncing the Finnish army  you know you have a good hand. Again  the USSR had every opportunity to keep pushing and be in Helsinki by May at most.
FuzzyLoveRabbit,movies,2015-03-17 15:31,It's like Stalinist Russia up in this bitch  these days  everyone that has a different opinion is seen as a shill or an operative or something.

AndyAwesome,syriancivilwar,2015-03-17 15:45,It doesnt even need that  baathist tyrant paranoia has swept plenty of loyal people away  for no good reason. Or for example Stalin  he executed loads of his own ilk. Keeps everybody guessing whos next  dont think about even the mildest form of dissent  and you better be not the one who stops clapping first at the party convention.

Mmmslash,hoggit,2015-03-17 15:52,Hi there!  I co-run the ***Wings Wednesdays*** and ***Wings European Wednesdays*** events over at /r/clearbackblast  as well as out Dedicated server (big shoutout to my IL-2 better-half  **Fixie**!) and have been playing BoS for the last six months or so  so I thought I would pitch in my thoughts and impressions so far.  **The Good**: Battle of Stalingrad is the best World War 2 Flight Simulator to date. I love 1946 as much as the next guy  but it's definitely a situation of quantity over quality. I don't need 13 different models of the G.50  especially since I know they don't have actual data on every individual model.  Flying in BoS is a dream. Everything about it just feels good. Banking up into the sky and falling back down on the Soviets in your 109 is incredible. It plays great  feels great  and is just a genuine joy. If you like World War 2 air combat  you owe it to yourself to play this. The flight models and damage models are both pretty much excellent  and there is little more thrilling than watching the rivets in your wing slowly come loose as you desperately try to get on the ground before it finally tears loose. It truly is beautiful.  If you're like me  you're probably more into the cooperative business than the dogfight stuff  and fortunately  five months after launch  that finally exists. It's a little wonky  but the forums are slowly cranking out missions and the editor (if a bit jank) is functional. We're having a really good time  and it's nice to see 12 WWII fighters in the air simultaneously for the first time since the mid 2000's  for me.  Support has also been consistent  with major patches and discussions about them every two to four weeks. They recently announced a standalone expansion (Think Forgotten Battles) focused around the Battle of Moscow. Word was that it was supposed to entire early access this month  but we'll see. You can expect the new map (with multiple season variations  BoS' Stalingrad should see this same treatment in Q3) and 10 new planes. Some are earlier models  most are brand new.  **The Bad**: Single player might as well not exist. You will not be doing your dynamically generated campaigns of yore. You will fly missions that loosely fit each other and strictly fit the war's timeline. The only reason to play this mode is to unlock plane modifications (if you do not own the two Premium planes  which would allow you to unlock all modifications instantly) and skins  and since custom skins are supported  that end of it underwhelming.  Some folks also have some issues with the Fw-190's flight model. Personally  I think they're wrong. Still  even today there was a major patch that was released  tweaking these values (and many others).  Additionally  BoS is a $60 / $100 (USD) product. Whether those two additional planes are worth the extra $40 is up to you. Without them  again  you will need to play the underwhelming single-player experience. Consider that the Battle of Moscow standalone expansion will probably be priced in an identical manner  8 planes for $60 and 10 for $100.  If you have any specific questions  let me know. I love Stalingrad  but I am ready to accept it's issues. 
sovietterran,AgainstGamerGate,2015-03-17 15:55,Should I just inverse the term and day rights of states  or should you grow up and learn to parse context?   Racists have used PoC in the past  and Stalin used calls for the good of the people to kill millions. Doesn't make either term inherently loaded.    If you cannot discuss a larger idea because one of the terms in it has been used in a negative light  then you are not making the bare minimum attempt at dialog.    Changing the way I phrase things just means you'll find a new angle to ignore what I said. 
DaCheesemack,Warthunder,2015-03-17 16:06,The 23mm is not the problem  it's the stalinium armor the plane gets. It's just overpowered. Amazing armor and survivability *and* x2 23mm guns. What this fuck is that?
SyncVir,leagueoflegends,2015-03-17 16:07,Hmm they've changed every one but 1  and its still not working.  Unpopular as it might be  but and I personally don't think its will make any difference this spit but ur Bench Froggen?   Real talk    Wicked top has pretty much failed to win his lane or carry or play remotely close to the level you expect from a top team. I would bench him.  Shock has great games  and awful games  he is too inconsistent on a team that's built around him getting froggen ahead so he can carry.  Froggen  Farms to much  plays to passive  and i tried remembering when he roamed around and helpped his other lanes in a game. After 10 minutes I gave up. He's a passive farm heavy mid  which isn't meta atm  though with Tank junglers coming back. It could soon be about staling out games again... ur Hurray??  Rekkles. If they hadn't spent so much time hyping him joining  i wouldn't have noticed him on the team at all. He actually does stuff right? Cause another farm heavy player on a team... Yay not good enough this season at all.  Kerpo - just joined  played okay  tried to make plays which they need.  Dexter - Just joined  has a history of camping the shit out of mid and getting them ahead to carry games. Wasn't remotely shocked to see Elements pair him with Froggen. If he's more consistent then Shook Elements will improve.  All in all Elements need is time  a new top laner and for Froggen and Rekkles to learn to play on the front foot. Farming is nice  but going all in and getting ahead with a double kill  its simply better.  ... Or  They could scape into Summer  higher an unbanned Incarnation move Froggen top. This however is just crazy talk.

Cyridius,socialism,2015-03-17 16:13,You're not going to get a single correct answer to this question.  My response would be that the conditions in the USSR at the time were not conducive to a proper Proletarian Dictatorship. Production was a fraction of its pre-war level  the working class was destroyed by war  the Communist Party was depleted. This led to greater use of the old Tsarist bureaucracy as a crutch for management of the state.  Ultimately  this all took its toll on the state and the Party took actions under pressure from the rich peasant population  like Lenin's New Economic Policy  which was a step back on the road to Socialism.   Being faced with the contradictions of needing to organise a Socialist form of social organisation  and needing to appease the peasant classes eg. Kulaks  Party members like Stalin rose to the top of the Party with the support of the peasantry  due to his policies(eg. supporting NEP  anti-collectivism etc.)  Eventually  the state's failure started to become imminent and the Party's response to that was to restrict democratic institutions and enact more aggressive policies against the peasantry. This was never really undone and you had a merging of the state bureaucracy and the Party  and a stagnation of the progress towards Socialism and a gradual degeneration of the revolution  ultimately leading to a restoration of Capitalism.

dubsteping,worldnews,2015-03-17 16:19,"ok lets play this game.   How is Russia's behavior doing anything to help or solve any problems? How will it possibly affect the status quo in any way other than getting people killed? ""No one can blame them"" for threatening the entire world on behalf of nationalistic pride? I sure as hell can.  National security is important  there is nothing they can do to alleviate US attacks except fight back  the alternative is to accept US dominance and bend the knee  Russia culturally and traditionally does not do that  no one dominates Russians  not since mongol times. They are not left with any options  its either do what you are told or we continue our attacks  the US has left no room for compromise  its either you let us win or we keep hitting you over the head. Russia is choosing to fight  under this ultimatum  same way they did with hitler and napoleon. This has saved them in the past  perhaps it will save them now  the Washington war hawks are evil  greedy and they are cowards  they will have to back down or Russia will unleash such terrible vengeance that generations yet unborn will cry out in anguish (that was for comedic effect)   The country simply has no choice  let the bullies beat you down or rise up and fight  perhaps then the bullies will leave you alone. simple school yard tactics  we are all kids anyway and then we die.    The baltics and poland have had ""salt poured in their eyes"" by Russia for a long time  but for some reason this didn't give them the right to go to NATO for protection in your world of double standards.  Russia does not do these things anymore  they had good reason to go into Georgia (Georgia attacked Russian peace keepers) Ossetia and Ukraine (what did the US do with a similar situation in cuba? what will it likely do if Russia regime changed Canada or mexico? try to think objectively)    Russia doesn't bother nations (they have a noninterventionist policy  while the US has the exact opposite)  at least not as much as the USSR  but remember  when the USSR did bad things it was not controlled by Russians  but by Georgia  stalin was Georgian not Russian its like blaming spain alone for the sins of the EU.  or blaming Kansas for something done by the people of Washington. The USSR was a huge place encompassing many nations and they were not always leaders of this Union of republics  why are they then to blame for its sins? especially when the leadership during bad times was held by someone from one of these republics and it was not Russia.    When was the last time a multipolar world brought an era with less conflict than a hegemonic world? Certainly not during the lifetime of anyone currently living. Multiple poles of power didn't do anything to ""check"" or ""balance"" the cold war. Or World War 2. Or World War 1.  Look you can say all these things because you won the birth lottery and are living in a nice place  what of all the millions who have died or are suffering because of US hegemony? You live in paradise while the rest of the worlds population (the majority) live under the US hefty boot  while it deems who can live and who should die for its whims and fancy.   This tyranny and abuse of power and position  is now leading to WW3  just because those that they have consistently stompped on are fucking tired of it and are looking to revolt. Look at the disgusting groups that have risen precisely as a result of US policies  look at people having their heads cut of and eyes gorged out. Its a fucking nightmare to be frank.    You are clearly missing the irony that Russia's push to challenge a unipolar world is bring the world closer to war  As I said above the conditions of this unipolar world are leading people to rise up  no one wants to be constantly bullied  no one likes it  and least of all the Russians  they are just more educated organized and culturally stable to rise up and say NO! no more  while the rest resort to animalistic and evil terrorism. China is in the same boat as the Russians  india as well  latin America etc. The only one seating at the podium decreeing this and that and deciding how people live and who dies is the US and its handful of rich minions. A corrupt force trying to rule over the world through deceit  force and trickery.     I'm no supporter of the US or their actions  but that doesn't mean I'm going to support cutting the nose to spite the face and fuck up the whole world just to take the US down a peg. That's kindergarten tactics.  You are right  you and I don't support the US government  but I love the American people  and I would not support cutting off the nose to spite the stupid proverbial face  but I call a spade a spade  people are fed up  wishful thinking will not quiet them down  change is what is needed  change that Obama promised and thereby excited the world  and gave people hope  he has failed or has lied to us all. OR his handlers  the greedy corps that run America  have forced him  he perhaps doesn't want to die  just like Bobby kennedy. Perhaps that's what has kept them in power and US presidents seemingly evil  the fear that those guys will blow their brains out all over the street using their own SS or so.   This tyranny is reaching a boiling point  and will boil over soon enough  the status quo cannot realistically continue for long  we will all die (weapons have gotten too terrible these days) if they don't back down  if they don't relinquish their grip on states and try to form a more equitable world  if not Russia then someone else  its just a matter of time.     So lets not just blindly blame the Russians   lets blame the real culprits  the people making everyone go crazy with their oppression  no one likes or wants to be a slave  people sooner or later rise up  that's human nature  same as the French revolution  soon enough the downtrodden masses will have had enough and someone will cart-in the guillotine. Its inescapable  if not Russia then someone else  but presently Russia is the only country strong enough to resist  when shit starts flying all the disenfranchised and abused will flock to them  but the battle may not leave anything left... That is the great fear  but what other choice does the world have? perhaps if the US was willing to negotiate rather than place ultimatums  we can all live happily ever after... but I shudder to think what will happen if the US hardlines and tries to call the Russians bluff... I know Russians they don't fucking bluff  when they had it  they have had it and they wouldn't give a fuck  they have a saying ingrained into them  its better to die than live on your knees. That's the attitude that has saved them for centuries.   "
RealitySubsides,socialism,2015-03-17 16:23,But the majority are the people coming into power. The old conservatives are dying out. As the young replace them  we'll see a shift in the general person's ideology. I cannot say this enough  violence will destroy any chance we have at success in this. Empathy is far more widespread than ever before. Empathy will aid those in accepting socialism  even if it doesn't directly affect them. That's why we just need to show them that we aren't advocating Stalin's communism. We're talking about helping the working man  making sure everyone is represented in the government. We can help people understand this through logic and rationality  not violence. Going a violent route will guarantee two things: we will lose  and we will lose our chance to change things. We will be seen as rioters  as people causing chaos for chaos's sake. The point of the violence will be forgotten  our message will be lost in the trail of blood and destruction left in our wake.

Moofaa,itmejp,2015-03-17 16:33,"This is the worst show I have ever seen and the GM is crap. It's up there with things like Stalin and green beans as the worst things to ever have existed.  Just kidding. It's actually excellent and the Steven is amazing along with the large cast of players.  I haven't had a chance to watch episode 10 (youtube viewer and I have no internet at home because 'murica"").   So heres my answers to your questions  for what little my opinion matters   1. The format of a rotating cast of players keeps the show fresh (+9). Whatever selection process you have for choosing players is working well (+8). It takes a while to get some groups together to continue their storylines (-4). And sometimes its a little annoying when groups get bogged down with random encounters and never get to do what they originally started (-3). Those negatives are mostly just a result of the format however  nothing is perfect.  2. It's interesting how much mileage you can get story-wise out of a handful of low-level characters just by throwing in some randomness and good role-playing. You don't need to be a 20th level whatever just to be cool or even a local hero (Kurthak is becoming well-known for instance).  Now for GM advice   1. Nothing really to add. You do a fine job overall.   2. Just keep running things the way you are. Most of the players you've had on the show have done really well with making their own stories. My only word of caution here is that things could get TOO complicated if characters start mixing between groups a little too often. Luckily JP is using new characters in many sessions. Some cross-over is welcome  but its something that could spiral out of control.  3. Much like #2  if you keep having great players and letting randomness and player  interaction drive the story you will end up with all sorts of cool developments. "

Proletarianization of the kulaks was what Trotsky argued for  not Stalin  until later Stalin realized that Trotsky was right."
Windex007,worldnews,2015-03-17 16:47,I can easily imagine it. How did Stalin handle dissent in his country? Those who drew images he felt undermined his authority? How on Earth was this violence and suppression possible without being religious in nature?  And you're right  Race and gender aren't even in the same ballpark as religion. Racial based conflict and death historically dwarf religious based conflict.  One of us is grasping at straws.  You seem to think that a human construct has reversed it's role as a product of human thought and become the dictator of human thought  robbing humans of their agency. How convenient it is that wars fought in the name of religion are so perfectly aligned with the will of those in power at the time. How incredibly coincidental that what those in positions of political power want can be obtained by doing morally problematic things that just so happen to be found to be acceptable by twisting a religion to suit their agenda. How *incredibly* lucky for them.  One of us is being very naive.
hai-faiv,socialism,2015-03-17 16:54,Stalin and Stalinist rulers distorted communism/socialism ideologically. Also  many of these regimes were propped up by the USSR under Stalin  and some rulers were even directly hand-picked by Stalin  such as Kim Il-sung.  Instead of a genuine socialist society  organized democratically  Stalinism's ideal society was a totalitarian bureaucratic state-capitalist dictatorship. Instead of progressing society forward socially  these regimes often promoted social conservatism  nationalism  and xenophobia.   The regimes that we saw  are a result of that distortion. So their connection to socialism  or even to the left at all  is very tenuous. Due to the Stalinization of the international communist movement  anyone advocating for a democratic socialist society was sidelined  politically repressed or brutally repressed. One such tragic example of the latter is Ta Thu Thau  Vietnamese Trotskyist leader.  
sydtron,politics,2015-03-17 16:57,  most of us are really just folks that want the Fiscal responsibility the GOP USED to claim it wanted  Fiscal responsibility in what sense? Most of what fiscal responsibility comes down to was invented shortly after Goldwater and the rest of his crazy ass chickenhawks took up the libertarianism mantle to distance themselves from the Rockefellers in the party. The Republican party began to tread slowly away from racist appeal and changed their tune to economic prosperity through destroying the welfare state. The birth of the welfare queen (which is commonly attributed to a non-white person  despite the example given by Reagan being a white woman) along with the notion that the welfare state being some sort of economic restriction toward white male economic mobility. While it's more difficult to refute that point  there's very little evidence that economic prosperity and a well funded welfare state can't go hand-in-hand.   Small government is not the same as no government.  Small government is just shifting governance from one form to another. Instead of an elected President being the figurehead of a government  it would just be the CEO of Standard Oil or a consortium of mining company CEOs dictating things. The US has a pretty established past of a form of government popping up  just like nature abhorring a vacuum  society abhors a power vacuum. Pinkertons and others formed the for-hire army  and they were plenty fine with killing Americans if their price was met. Roads  dams and other projects were created  too  but only for the wealthy and if you were hurt by them who cares  you didn't have enough money to matter.  Libertarianism  again  is failed political philosophy. Every time the same horse shit pops up in America and every time it's at the tail end of economic malaise. It's similar to Stalinism in that it throws out some bullshit that people eat up because it sounds great but in the end  it concentrates power in the hands of the unelected few.
Cuxham,MapPorn,2015-03-17 17:01,No economy on a total war footing is ever designed to be sustainable. A hypothetical post-win Nazi Europe with Middle-Eastern and Caucasus oil and with African rubber/metals/uranium would be entirely sustainable  at least as much as Stalin's Union was.

gameronice,worldnews,2015-03-17 17:19,Yeah  you have little grasp of the whole picture  no knowledge of engineering  real-estate and limited points of reference. Pretty standard cherry picking as they like to imagine it these days. But once you dive deeper  into history and technical data  which I did back in the university  talking to people who lived from 30 till now  form a big picture  it's not even close to how you describe it.   Once again  I know a lot about how stuff was build and made in Latvia  it largely contradicts most of what you say. Same can be told about many other places. 1950s and early 60s were very rough  but clearly you never looked at statistics and compared them. There are eras in soviet construction  each had own ideas and tendencies  starting with stalin-era massive buildings that were on par to pre-war city housing (even now it's very prestegios to live in these houses)  to mass constructed panel and brick buildings  some bad some real good even by western standards. Try and do some real estate comparing fro Talin  pre-war  during soviet rule  and after it. Compare population growth and many other things.   People give USSR a lot of bad rep  some of it rightfully deserves  specially the bloody Stalin times  but after that it's like people ignore anything else  all the grand projects and designs that people take for granted even now  and take take to compare to 30 years later  after 10 years of poverty and little support of the infrastructure. Like Stalin ruled from 30 way to 1992. No big picture  Sheesh.
stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill  Roosevelt  Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
aleksey2,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:22,"To clarify  Ukraine and Belarus didn't get annexed after WW2  but were enlarged in size by seizing land from ""liberated"" countries (in quotes  cause while they did get liberated from the Nazis  it was held against them as though they had a bill to pay to the USSR for the aforementioned liberation). If I understand correctly  you're asking why the USSR didn't annex Poland  Romania  and Bulgaria and instead allowed them to remain independent states on paper. All the while  in practice  actually fully controlling what those countries got to do via their respective Socialist governments  who were puppets of the Kremlin? If that *is* your question  then there could be many explanations as to why  none of which are good enough to explain everything on their own. Having said that  I think two really good reasons as to why are 1) deniability and 2) creating a buffer zone.  **Deniability** - the best of both worlds  if your worlds consist solely of 'wanting to exert control' and 'not wanting to pay anything for it'. USSR was all like  ""Who me? Naah  bruh  I don't control those countries. They are *totally* independent  have their own *elected* governments and do as they please"".   When you annex a territory  you gotta deliver a benefit for the people you're annexing. Romans solved it by giving the conquered Roman citizenship and creating some peace and prosperity (albeit that changed depending on the era of Roman Republic/Empire). In return Romans got to extract/take what they wanted and needed from the new province. It hasn't really changed much - you gotta give the people you're conquering something in return for their freedom. And that's a costly endeavour  something that a war-torn country might not be willing to consider. Instead  if what you really want is to control the population AND you can get that control by getting the governments of those countries to do your bidding for you (and to coöperate fully with your requests)  then you've just achieved control without exerting any serious costs. Now you get what you want and you have to provide **none** of the services and benefits you would have had to if you annexed that same territory.  Btw  this all assumes that the territory in question isn't full of oil or any other natural resources. Cause in those cases  ""empires"" will still want to annex it any *any* cost.   **Buffer zone.** It wasn't exactly clear that a new conflict wasn't going to start after Berlin fell. The West never truly trusted the USSR and vice versa even while they shared the common enemy. With the new enemy soon-to-be gone (or now gone  if we're talking about post-may-1945)  it wasn't assumed that peace will reign in. The USSR was prepared for a new conflict  if it would arise  and the bigger the buffer zone between the West and Moscow  the better. Now  if you can control and coordinate with Polish/Romanian/Bulgarian governments and military without having to spend any money on their citizens  then you've achieve your objective. Now you can have a new war and hope that it stays contained within the countries on the periphery of USSR. You get two outcomes from this. Either USSR wins or it loses. In both cases you  the USSR  hope that the conflict takes place and *stays* in those countries. That way if you have to surrender and pull out  you haven't actually lost any territory that's your own. If it's a costly stalemate or if you win by way of 'scorched earth/leave no building standing' tactic of military attack  then you just make Poland/Romania/Bulgaria weaker in the process. Now whether you win or lose  they will be too poor and bombed out to either be a threat or to stand on their own. If they stay allied to Moscow  they'll be even weaker to resists Kremlin's influence. If they flip sides and join the West  then the logic is that it would be so costly to rebuild them and that the West would never want to spend the money to do so.  Fundamentally  the decisions of WW2 USSR and post-WW2 USSR were made by Stalin  a certified lunatic and a deranged psychopath who viewed the world as a constant ""us vs. them"" struggle and regarded all human lives with outmost of disregards (obligatory link to what happened to Stalin's own [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Dzhugashvili#Second_World_War))."

SorosPRothschildEsq,SubredditDrama,2015-03-17 17:30,Based on some posthumous rehabilitative crap they made up about how Stalin wouldn't have sent the tanks in (rofl) if he was still alive. Yeah  maybe he wouldn't have. Maybe he would have sent the Red Army over to butcher the people involved at an individual level instead.  I'm not an ultra-leftist  just a mere social-democrat. For most of us  tankie isn't so specific and simply means dead-ender apologists for a certain strain of communism or communist figure.
speznazhunter,UkrainianConflict,2015-03-17 17:31,Your argument seems to indicate that 82% of the population didn't feel it appropriate to argue with the heavily armed thugs that imposed this misery on them.  I seem to remember that Stalin's popularity  even among those who died in Russian labour camps approached 100%.  In retrospect  it seems that those numbers were a poor reflection of reality.
joe_arpaio_is_a_nazi,socialism,2015-03-17 17:33,Communism is a fairly vague term used to describe a variety of political ideologies. While you could certainly call Stalinism totalitarianism  that term would incorrect when referring to say  Luxemburgism or Trotskyism. I'm assuming the majority of those bothered by this hideously simplistic chart come from the latter sects of communism. Think of it like different denominations of Christianity  Christianity could be used to refer to a large of denominations which share many features  but completely fails to illuminate any differences between Mormonism and Eastern Orthodox.

lightsaberon,worldnews,2015-03-17 17:38," How did Stalin handle dissent in his country? Those who drew images he felt undermined his authority? How on Earth was this violence and suppression possible without being religious in nature?  I didn't say religion was the only way of inducing mass violence  but it is certainly the easiest and most effective.  Also  there's a huge difference between one man protecting his dominance and power and an entire society freely subjecting a cartoonist to violence.  Notice how today rates of racial and gender violence are much  much lower than ever before  yet religion sees continual peaks in war  atrocities and mass violence.   And you're right  Race and gender aren't even in the same ballpark as religion. Racial based conflict and death historically dwarf religious based conflict.  What a load of bullshit.  Where are the gender based atrocities?  Were women purged because of their gender?  What desperate nonsense.  There were racial conflicts in history  but what about now?  Religious wars and atrocities are a **daily** occurrence in 2015!!  Where are all those racial and gender equivalents?  In your imagination?   You seem to think that a human construct has reversed it's role as a product of human thought and become the dictator of human thought  robbing humans of their agency.  This is some absurd nonsense.  Religion is as much a part of ""human thought"" as it is a ""human construct"".  As are all manner of other things.  Human agency is simply our capacity to act  to do something.  No one's speaking of robbing human's of their ability to do things.     How convenient it is that wars fought in the name of religion are so perfectly aligned with the will of those in power at the time. How incredibly coincidental that what those in positions of political power want can be obtained by doing morally problematic things that just so happen to be found to be acceptable by twisting a religion to suit their agenda. How incredibly lucky for them.  Oh so it's all about an ulterior motive?  So  tell me what exactly is the ulterior motive behind entire societies (not individuals) freely supporting violence against people who draw cartoons insulting a religious figure?  Do they stand to gain money  power  fame?   One of us is being very naive.  I definitely agree there.  "

RallyUp,television,2015-03-17 17:41,Hang on though  the Nazi's really were trying to take over all of Europe and eradicate as many of what they called 'sub human' minorities off the earth as they could. A shitload of that was complacency with country and kin  just like the U.S. and it's militarized youth are seeing today. But at the end of the day if the world hadn't stomped that shit out  they may well have overwhelmed the British before Japan forced America into the war. That really was a war. It was conquest on the part of the Germans  and the reason they let old Adolf become such a force had a lot to do with the perceived wrongs against the German people by the rest of the world  but France in particular. They always had it out for the French. They wanted to wait the British and the Soviet Russians out but he ended up scaring Stalin with his (Hitler) heavy handed tactics and overall blitzkrieg approach.    But I digress. They were truly an evil force of hatred that had to be destroyed. I agree with you on the other points but when it comes to legitimate Nazi's I have to draw a line. Even today  knowing what I know and the revelations of modern shit like Internet and social networking  I would still join the fight against Nazism if it grew to the point it was in the 30's and 40's. That shit was for the most part  just pure evil. Geo politically based evil. But pure fucking evil.

Hermann_Von_Salza,european,2015-03-17 17:49,"There are also trends in academia against nationalism  which filter out to the public.  Benedict Anderson's *Imagined Communities* was a particularly influential work.  Predictably  it portrays nationalism as a social construct.  The logical conclusion is that internationalism  or ""continentalism"" of the EU variety  is the solution  ignoring that these are also social constructs.  These same people often decry multinational corporations  the IMF  the World Bank  and corporate inversions  but fully support international law.  Financial support from historically internationalist groups  known as ""rootless cosmopolitans""  historically threatened by nationalist groups and moving from country to country  is never discussed.  I wouldn't quite put it on the Soviet Union.  The mid-1920's Soviet struggles between the Left Opposition  led by Trotsky and initially supported by Lev Kamenev and Grigorii Zinoviev  lost the struggle  as did the NEP right opposition of Nikolai Bukharin.  Stalinism is highly centered around ""Socialism in one country "" as the Piedmont Strategy failed and Stalin became more distrustful of the borderlands and exporting socialism.  He eventually dissolved Comintern in 1943."

RamblinRambo3,european,2015-03-17 18:44,  Id like to see some real objective proof for all these allegations against him.  How easy was it to get proof on the corruption of Lenin  Stalin  or any other Soviet leader. Or even the fact that Jeltsin was set aside from power. Russia doesn't work that way. Same with China. Everyone knows they're corrupt but they'll kill anyone trying to expose them. You know this. Would you ask me to provide proof of Obama being corrupt?  To me it really seems as if you're staring at the reality but won't allow yourself to accept it.  But to give you something of the little that has been said:   Under Putin  theft by officials has gone from a bad situation to a catastrophic one...Our international corruption ratings are confirmed by Russian government data. According to RosStat  the number of crimes recorded under the category “Corruption” rose by 87% between 2000 and 2009 – from 7000 to 13000.   According to Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation V. Lebedev  in 2008 only 25% of persons accused of bribe-taking received prison terms while 65% were given suspended sentences. Back when we published “Putin: The Results”  talk of Putin’s mighty personal friends with access to billions – Timchenko  the Kovalchuk brothers  the Rotenberg brothers – circulated only as rumours. Now  however  all these people can be found quite officially in the listings of Russian billionaires. According to Forbes magazine  Gennadi Timchenko is 36th in that list  with a wealth of $1.9 billion. Yuri Kovalchuk comes in at #67 with nearly $1 billion. Brothers Arkadi and Boris Rotenberg occupy slots 99 and 100 with a combined wealth of $1.4 billion. Putin has installed at the feeding trough not only his closest friends  but their relatives too. Yuri Kovalchuk’s son Boris was  at the age of 29  placed at the head of the Department of National Projects of the Government of Russia  which he ran from 2006 to 2009. When National Projects was rolled up  Boris Kovalchuk was given the post of Deputy Director of RosAtom and in late 2009 sent to head InterRAO  the state monopoly for electricity import/export. Meanwhile  Yuri Kovalchuk’s brother Mikhail heads the Kurchatov Institute [Russia's leading research and development institution in the field of nuclear energy - Trans.]   which the state has been financing in recent years to the tune of tens of billions of roubles. The Rotenberg brothers built their business on supplying pipes and providing building services to Gazprom. This despite the fact that they neither made nor built anything. Back in 2003-2004  Boris Rotenberg was a junior partner in Gaztaged  a company with a turnover of about $1 billion  through which pipe purchases for Gazprom were routed. He later acquired shares in SEPT (North European Pipe Project)  a pipe-trading company with a turnover of around $1.5 billion which is going to supply pipes to the North Stream pipeline project. Arkadi Rotenberg controls StroiGasMontazh  a group which in 2008 bought controlling shares in 5 Gazprom subsidiaries making pipelines for the North Stream  the “Olympic” Dzhubga-Lazarevskoye-Sochi  and other pipeline projects. In 2008  Timchenko’s partner in oil-trader Gunvor  Torbjörn Törnqvist  admitted in a letter to the editor of British newspaper The Guardian that Gunvor does have a “third beneficiary”. But who that is  no one knows.   Putin declared that his income for 2009 amounted to 3.9 million roubles (~$125 000). On this income  our prime-minister was able to give a boy shepherd in the Tula region a wristwatch worth $10 500 only magically to be seen wearing a new model of the same a few days later. Medvedev  who declared that he earned 3.3 million roubles (~$106 000) in 2009  owns a flat in the super-élite Zolotye Klyuchi apartment complex  where the maintenance charge alone is at least $5000 a month. The watch Medvedev wears costs $32 200. The president’s and the prime-minister’s suits come from Brioni and Kiton (these go for €5000-7000 a shot) and are what Russia’s billionaires prefer. Against the backdrop of the collapse in road-building and of much of the country’s infrastructure  our country’s leaders are building and restoring residences for their beloved selves out of the state budget  About Putin caring for his people:   Putinist mythology would have it that we are seeing successes on the demography front  that the birth rate is rising  and so on and so forth. This is compounded by spreading another myth that the country “was dying out in the 1990s”. Let us look at the facts.Our population at 1 January 1992 was 148.5 million people  at 1 January 2000 it was 146.9 million. (Table data from RosStat). The drop between these two dates was therefore 1.6 million. At 1 January 2010  Russia’s population numbered 141.9 million  giving a drop of a whopping 5 million between 2000 and 2010.   The bitter truth therefore is that Russia has been losing 500 000 people a year over the last decade  a rate that bears no comparison with even the 1990s.   The main reason that our population is declining is supermortality. Around 15 per 1000 die every year. In July 2009  Russia could be found 12th from the bottom in the global mortality listing. Our neighbour on the list are Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Chad  Somali. **We have been maintaining African mortality levels in our country for many years now.** The problem is supermortality. The Russian government does not care for its population. One million six hundred thousand babies are born every year while 2 100 000 people die.   Russian mortality rates began to rise in the 1970s under Brezhnev and continued to do so right up to the mid 1990s. In 1995  mortality began to decrease and fell to under 2 million a year in 1998. Under Putin  however  rates rose again and accelerated to reach a new peak in 2003  when 2.37 million deaths were recorded. The rate has not dropped below 2 million since then.   Russia’s exceptionally high mortality is the result of a concatenation of reasons. Nearly 60% of deaths are recorded as from cardiovascular causes  another 15% from cancer. Respiratory organs and digestive tracts claim another 4% each. Russia is outstanding for its number of deaths from external causes – 12.5% of the total or more than 260 000 people annually. This is approximately twice as many as in China or Brazil and 4-5 time more than in Western countries.  You can read the report here: http://www.putin-itogi.ru/putin-what-10-years-of-putin-have-brought  If you really want to dig into it  there's a lot more.   The country was looted after perestroika and **the special minority oligarchs started festering**.  Putin is par of that oligarchy.  
westalist55,worldnews,2015-03-17 18:47,Of course Ukraine is a cluster fuck  the Russians have been abusing them for hundreds of years.

Then came the nuclear disaster  a result of Soviet Engineering incompetence.    Finally  with the Euromaidan  it looked like Ukraine could finally throw off the Russian yoke  and realigning itself to the West  and advance as a country. Naturally  Putin wouldn't have that.    Hence  Ukraine remains a freaking hellhole.

The allies only ended up allying with the Russians just to beat the Nazis but they weren't friendly with Stalin  who they knew was a massive cock.

Pochetnyy,AMA,2015-03-17 19:02,I'm afraid that's not the case. The collapse of the USSR was brought on by a failing economy  which was a result of constant war and Reagan-like management  repression of personal liberties  as it wasn't a Communist Nation  over-extension  and pressure from every first world country. When Lenin took power his policies alienated the class peasantry  which is a testament to how careless he was  and then Stalin took power and well... This would never happen in a real Communism. Of course people are naturally selfish  but the law in terms of wealth gain really only restricts the expropriation of labor. So in principle  if people want more money  they can make more money  all they have to do is work hard  or gain a more valuable job.

HawaiiFO,todayilearned,2015-03-17 19:19,"Briton also had plans to take out 90% of Soviet oil production by bombing Baku from Iran/Iraq if the German/Soveit pact had held and they kept trading oil with Germany.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pike  ""an oil shortage would cripple the Red Army and Soviet Air Force  as well as Soviet collective farm machinery  causing possible widespread famine and even the collapse of the Soviet Union: ""Dependence on oil supplies from the Caucasus is the fundamental weakness of Russian economy. The Armed Forces were totally dependent on this source also for their motorized agriculture. More than 90% of oil extraction and 80% of refinement was located in the Caucasus (primarily Baku). Therefore  interruption of oil supplies on any large scale would have far-reaching consequences and could even result in the collapse of all the military  industrial and agricultural systems of Russia.""  IMO  this would have also been Germany's best shot at taking out The USSR at the start of Barbarossa. Hitlers folly up intill and including Stalingrad ( where he broke off 25% of Stalingrads starting attacking force to try and take Baku intact  rather than get Stalingrad over with quickly  then and only then mop up Baku after cutting them off) was Germany didn't need ANY extra oil for themselfs if the USSR also wasn't producing very much.    If German stratagy from the start  The Germans would have needed to conquer at least 200-300 miles into the Ukraine to set up airfields with the bombers capable of reaching Baku round trip (range at the time). If planned better they could have also maybe sent in 25 000 men in gliders on a one way suicide/sabatoge mission to Baku instead of wasting them on Crete.

Regardless it's worse than what we have right now.    They'd be galled at you making that mistake too.  Rothbard and Hayek would be galled at you to suggest we have a free market today. So again  lets not compare our utopias with one another  but our worst cases.
asdfman2000,AskMen,2015-03-17 19:27,I agree. It's a good thing southern states were forced to integrate and treat minorities with respect similar to how northern states. Ferguson is a perfect example. An unarmed black man would never be murdered by police in New York.  You'd never see segregation in this bastion of freedom. Certainly not the 10 most segregated cities in the US: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#Contemporary_segregation   Look: There is no perfect system. The constitution and federal government is there to ensure basic civil rights and equal protection  but ultimately any democracy requires a compassionate  informed citizenry.  A strong central government isn't a cure-all (and neither is decentralization). You point to American slavery and post-slavery as what's wrong with decentralization  but seem to forget the horrors under Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin  or even the internment of Japanese-Americans all happened under strong central governments. Remember  it was the federal government the prosecuted war against the American Indians.  Just because the states do something shitty  it doesn't mean the federal government isn't capable of doing equally shitty things on a larger scale.
spitfire333,ColdWarMapGame,2015-03-17 19:27,The Kingdom of Iraq reluctantly offers an official denunciation of the Soviet Union  though they are skeptical this will do much. They have been put off by the lack of clear Iranian success  and in the very possible event of a Soviet victory  they fear being put on Stalin's shit-list.
ForeignPolicyHawk,PoliticalDiscussion,2015-03-17 19:30,Confucianism means that authoritarianism is more welcome. Also it's more valuable the worse off you are - you don't give a shit about your rights  you give a shit that you can't eat every day. So what if you can't complain about the government if they feed you?  They used their dictatorship style rule to build a strong economy. Also  they did their best to court American investment.  This model has been repeated with small changes by South Korea  Malaysia and Taiwan if you want to see it work on a larger scale. Even China to some extent.  What it leads to is that a strong state will facilitate economic growth and that people will allow it to as long as they don't sacrifice too many liberties in the process of gaining better status. Stalin and Mao style economic changes don't work anymore (the world is too interconnected) so you can't just mass murder people to get industrialization. But you can dictate policy (similar to an enlightened despot).

It is also true that many Westerners highlight only the negatives and suppress the positives with a racial bias.   And the last time complex socio-political issues were analyzed with simplistic high-school logic equations  it gave rise to the likes of Hitler and Stalin  who had very ""simplistic"" solutions to the problems their countries were facing."

SolidBlues,CommunismWorldwide,2015-03-17 9:33,"  You're fetishisting Marx and Engels. They're by no means the only thinkers worthy of consideration when it comes to Communism.  I'm going to mostly ignore this silly accusation but they are *by no means* the only revolutionaries I'm considering with regard to the anarchists.    their desire to destroy all systems of authority and hierarchy naturally lead to Communism which is precisely why they're Communists  It would naturally lead to anarchy not communism which is why they're anarchists. Abolishing private property and class society is not about destroying systems of authority or hierarchy. [As Engels wrote about](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm) there will always be people telling other people how to do things.    And the only reason we call the experiments that occured in countries such as Russia and China Communist is because of that legacy.  The reason we call Stalin's USSR and Mao's China 'communist' (although I would actually call it socialist but that's another discussion) is because they were trying build communism. Not because they called themselves communists.  Anarchists are and will always be counter-revolutionary to Marxist aims. [As Stalin wrote](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1906/12/x01.htm) ""We believe that the Anarchists are real enemies of Marxism"" and so do I."
frukt,MapPorn,2015-03-17 9:33,As an Estonian I'd like to extend my thanks to the American people and government for holding on to that principle for 50 years. It didn't merely have token value  if I recall correctly Estonia had an embassy in the US during the Cold War which enabled a political podium and supported the restoration of Estonia's independence on the basis of legal continuity in 1991. Several other countries simply gave away Estonian property to the occupying USSR  Sweden even extradited some Estonian refugees to USSR at the time of Stalinist terror (who obviously ended up executed or in Siberian hard labor camps). The US also became a welcoming home to many displaced persons from Estonia. 
Teh_Sauce_Guy,justneckbeardthings,2015-03-17 9:33,I didn't call him an idiot just not smart  And about half of those things were not *smart* they just went in a different direction than most people were going in the time.   If you're talking about mein kampf it's pretty widely agreed that the way it's written is basically a big morass of nonsense. I have no idea how it got popular but it was all bullshit.  Also it's not a smart idea to go to war with a superpower and two pre superpowers even more so when you've started to lose a lot of battles.   And then there's getting mad at Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin and calling them Jews because they went against you and/or beat you in battle. 
MorXpe,europe,2015-03-17 9:45,The major part of Stalin's propaganda towards personality cult took place after WW2. So yea he could draw some inspiration from Hitler's success although it's not like Hitler was the first dictator to know the trick.
finjeta,russia,2015-03-17 9:50,"I didn't say finland won we didn't.      ""why would you destroy something you'd want to take for yourself?"" Because it's easier to take something when you don't have to make your way trough fortified positions when attacking. Why would they have even wanted those defences since if they had taken whole of finland then they had fought germans in the lapland. And comparing war to peacfull annexion wouldn't be fair we could instead compare it to chechen wars. There were heavy damages to local buildings and as such I doupt the damage would too different to what the other wars were.      ""There would be no reason to conquer it if it succeeded"" How do you plan on placing a puppet government in Helsinki without invading it first. Stalin abandoned the puppet governemnt after the war was over because they couldn't be placed to lead finland.      Sure USSR could have taken finland if they had continued their offence for few weeks to take Viipuri and then another 2-6 weeks for rest of the country but the reason Stalin wanted to end the war was because he wanted the embaresing war to end quickly it's good to note that Soviet Union deployed 1/4 of their entire active military to finnish front and had barely advanced what they were suposed to have by the day 7. Second reason for Stalin wanting to end the war was because he knew that if France and UK would see Soviet union as an enemy he would have hard time getting them to help him against Hitler instead of them just minding their own fronts."

Anacarbo,podemos,2015-03-17 9:53,Cada año leemos cuántas mujeres han sido asesinadas por sus parejas masculinas y obviamos los casos contrarios. Que los homosexuales y las lesbianas se maten no importa porque el régimen feminista realmente no intenta salvar a nadie sino enfrentar a los dos géneros. Pero hablando estrictamente el Sistema no oculta las muertes de ellos. Realmente y por mor de la terminología los hombres muertos por violencia de género no existen. La Ley Integral diseñada como las normas hitlerianas solamente para una parte de la población discrimina entre asesinados: sólo les otorga el paraguas del género a las mujeres muertas por sus parejas. Una chica a la que un extraño someta a un crimen machista tan repugnante como una violación no es víctima de violencia de género. Los niños muertos por sus padres tampoco cuentan en las estadísticas que determinan cómo se reparten el dinero las asociaciones feministas que cobran por número de denuncias conseguidas lo que convierte el lenguaje en dinero. En cuanto a los asesinatos de hombres el Sistema maquilla lingüísticamente hasta sus cadáveres. Al varón asesinado por su mujer le aplica la frase condenatoria algo habrá hecho la misma que utilizaba el franquismo con las asesinadas en un nuevo paralelismo entre feminismo y machismo.  La neolengua de Orwell en la España de 2012. Las cifras de suicidas masculinos se dispararon en España desde que en 2005 se popularizó el café para todas de los divorcios por la vía penal que arruinan a la mayoría de los hombres y llevan a la cárcel a un número de inocentes que nunca conoceremos. En 2006 el dato del estado civil desapareció de las estadísticas así que los hombres en trámites de separación que se quitaban la vida se evaporaron. Stalin borró de las fotos oficiales a un Trotsky caído en desgracia que pasó a nunca haber existido pero en esta ocasión eso les ha ocurrido a muchos miles de personas y teóricamente en una democracia. También borró realidades la neolengua de la novela 1984 de Orwell con la que un gobierno totalitario retorcía las palabras basándose en que lo que no forma parte de la lengua no puede ser pensado. Por eso no existe el término hembrismo. Sí conocemos cifras de suicidios que provienen del propio régimen feminista en concreto del Instituto Nacional de Estadística. Setenta y ocho de cada cien personas que se suicidaron en España en 2010 eran hombres. En la novela 1984 el ministerio que reescribe la historia para falsearla se llama ministerio de la Verdad. En pleno año 2010 el ministerio de la Mujer de la democracia española se llamaba ministerio de Igualdad.  @rafaelcerro  BIBLIOGRAFÍA: Las mujeres que no amaban a los hombres. Diego de los Santos.

RazDwaTrzy,europe,2015-03-17 10:10,"Frankly speaking nothing comes to my mind in terms of what communists could take from Hitler.  Since the end of the 'Great War' they'd been doing 'pretty well' with building machine of death on their own.  GULAG Cheka cult of Lenin Comintern terror - these had been parts of the system long before Hitler became strong enough to influence on Germany.  After Lenin's death in 1924 Stalin took the power and inherited popularity of his predecessor which from that point was raising very fast. With fear altogether.  One fine thing has just came to my mind which may describe differences and independence in ""thinking"" between those two systems - technology:  Hitler crossed the 'space border' with V2 rocket.  Stalin built White Sea–Baltic Canal with bare hands in record time of 3 years. It's the longest canal in the world and the most useless one as well. Technology used to build the canal was taken directly from middle-age period. Wood and blood."
oleg771409,explainlikeimfive,2015-03-17 10:10,"sorry ofr my english hope you will understand me. i will explain with steps. part 1 - in democracy 1. to governate a country (state) you need to know a lot of things  about economy agriculture history education and so on. People who vote do not know that theory that's why politicians can not speak with them on that level becouse nobody will understand him. For example: I am engineer and i am going in kindergarden to promote my services in instaling new heat system. For that we organise a meeting with childrens of 3-5 years old. If i will speak with them about efficiency it make no sense. I have to speak about colors and how nice it looks.  The same thing is politicians are speaking with us about income about good roads and so on. 2. 4-8 years terms of govrnemnt then revoting. minimum term of an strategy for one country is 200 years you can do nothing in 4 years. in 4 years you like a politician just have to do your piar campaign - tv show - for ex. meetings contracts and so on 3. Advertisment always will promise things which are impossible or just  good part of the things. 4. democracy can not exist without coruption. For example free media there oficial income a  too low. Profits they gain from illegal financing like Political party. 5. democracy is inefficient govrnement. Becouse if we have different political views in one govrnment the sum of the forces are less somebody goes to left somebody to right (""-"" + ""+"" = 0) 6. everytime in democracy is coming somebody who is promising changes.... changes are not stability for target 7. Government decide the control in the country and money decide who will be on govrnment   i can speak a lot about this.  Non democracy 1 They do  what they want and nobody can tell them what to do"
Michael123443,socialism,2015-03-17 10:15,Huh next thing your going to tell me is that Stalin didn't skin kittens alive for fun? Give me a break...
Honcho21,socialism,2015-03-17 10:18,I'd rather not given that I really don't think I know enough about Soviet history or Materialism but knowing the kind of gobshite that will come out of this thread I feel obligated to create some semi-coherent response.  We are materialists we view each changing epoch of society as a change from one ruling class to another as a result of the antagonisms that grow between the old ruling class and the new class that emerges out of a change in economic conditions. The Capitalist class replaced the old Feudal ruling class and established a new constitution and government that matched the needs of these new economic conditions.  The will happen/ has happened with Capitalism the working class will replace the Capitalist class as the ruling class. However the difference here being that the working class will be the majority of the population and therefore establish a democratic common ownership of society on the basis of a planned economy dictated by Worker's Councils/ Communes that will form the basis of a new government one from the bottom up where the central government plays a purely administrative role and where these local Councils now play the central role. This new government will replace the old constitution of Capitalist society and allow society to catch up with these new economic conditions.  The fundamental problem with Russia is that it's economic conditions were highly underdeveloped and remained largely Feudalistic in it's conditions to the point where the Tzarist Monarchy was still ruling while Monarchies had been neutered/ completely destroyed in most of Europe already. So what the Bolsheviks inherited was a semi Feudal country where the working class were a small minority of the population and the peasantry was still the majority. Unfortunately the peasantry were not so keen on Socialism why? I do not know but many were hostile to the Bolsheviks wile some peasants supported them.  What's worse is that much of the working class were killed off during the civil war as well as much of the industrial development Russia had was wiped out as well. As a result the central government had to essentially fill in where the working class didn't exist and so over time along side the necessity of fighting a war the Bolshevik government became heavily centralised. With a centralised and authoritarian government comes bureaucracy and it was a big concern for the Bolsheviks to keep the bureaucracy at bay however it was only 1924 when Lenin died and when Stalin took over.  I won't say much about Stalin other than he represented the very worst of this bureaucracy and allowed it to grow within the State which as a consequence meant that worker's control was never fully reestablished and remained as a top down authoritarian regime.  The reason so many Communist countries after the Soviet Union became like the Soviet Union was because it totally dominated the idea of Socialism in the 20th century most revolutionary governments were propped up by the Soviets and any revolutionary movements that were not in line with the Soviet bureaucracy were put down or taken over by Stalinist shills i.e the Spanish civil war France 1968 etc   Also: Socialism is international the October revolution remained isolated after the German revolution of 1919 failed this isolation was also a contributing factor to it's degeneracy because a bureaucracy cannot survive with the pressure of international revolution being forced upon it. The Russian revolution was dependent on the German revolution because unlike Russia Germany was a fully matured Capitalist State that would have supported Russia.

Radene,europe,2015-03-17 10:28,When Germany attacked USSR's territory losses were HUGE because they couldn't hold onto it. Only when the war turned around (and Stalin pointed Zhukov at the Germans) did the Russians start recovering that lost ground.

Apostrophe,russia,2015-03-17 10:52,"There are numerous logical reasons behind this:   First of all these troops are located at a new military base in Alakurtti. New military arrangements benefit from drilling. It is a useful test. This is a very sensible military reason. You put troops in a new place you check for new problems.  Secondly the troops are located on land that previously belonged to Finland land that Stalin took in WWII. With the recent transfer of Crimea to Russia there may be those who think that Russia is now open to correcting what the Russians have called *historical mistakes*. That's what they called Crimea going to Ukraine for example. So some might think that maybe Russia is now open to correcting some of the *historical mistakes* where Stalin took land from other countries. Placing troops there and announcing very public drills is a good way to show to everyone that Russia wants to keep this land - don't even bother asking.  Thirdly this sort of drilling very near to Finland obviously makes many Finnish people very nervous. The Russians attacked us once so maybe they're coming again? This increases support for joining NATO and the current government in Russia very much wants Finland to join NATO. They've been marketing a narrative that NATO is imperialistic and dangerous to Russia. That NATO is expanding towards Russia. That foreign forces are conspiring to destroy Russia. They want Russians to be afraid of the West. Another country joining NATO right next to Russia allows them to say : *""See! NATO is coming! Keep us in power we can protect you! Don't let the Western-minded liberals get into power! The West is dangerous!""*"

spondulicker,ireland,2015-03-17 11:02,Well I feel thats a bit strong Diarmuid Ferriter writes sometimes for the Irish Times he is a reputable historian and you would accuse him of bias. I was thumbing through Coogans bibliography he has a good amount of sources. And sometimes yes historians are biased but that makes for interesting perspectives. Eric Hobsbawm is a Marxist lifelong member of the Communist party and a bit of an apologist for Stalin (its tricky to pin him down conclusively) and he is one of the great historians of the 20th &amp  21st century. From what I remember the book seemed balanced enough..

tigernmas,ireland,2015-03-17 11:18,The difference would be Ferriter only writes sometimes for the Irish Times and the Irish Times has no close ties with any party.  Coogan on the other hand was editor for about 19 years with a paper founded by DeValera himself.  The difference with Hobsbawm would be that Hobsbawm has a doctorate in history from Cambridge whereas I can't find any information at a glance for Coogan. Hobsbawm is also known more for his history of the 19th century so his opinions on Stalin didn't really come into it.
PisseGuri82,MapPorn,2015-03-17 11:19,"There are better examples but these are the ones I could find right now from the *Grosser Herder Atlas* published in Bonn 1958.  [This](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8711/16843691401_fae444e5e7_h.jpg) political map of Europe sums up the West German view:  The German areas east of the Oder-Neisse are under Polish administration since 1945 southern East Prussia under Soviet administration.  The colouring leaves little doubt about how the map editor felt about that. In [this](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8571/16224804283_66db65f776_h.jpg) political map of Germany the West is called the *Bundesrepublik* but the DDR is not recognised as a nation it's still called the ""Soviet occupation zone"". The eastern part is labelled *Unter Polnischer Verwaltung*. (I've also seen *Zur Zeit unter Polnischer Verwaltung* i.e. ""Currently under Polish administration"") Also note that even though the *bezirke* (subnational levels reorganised by DDR in 1952) are coloured the old *länder* are more prominently named.  [This](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16844742735_07fdcd1373_h.jpg) climate map from the same atlas simply disregards the Oder-Neisse line totally using 1937 borders.  The West German government formally accepted the post-war border in 1970. Internationally I guess to the Allies bound by their deals with Stalin saw it as a a nice proxy way of getting leverage. They could say ""We have to formally accept the border but *people* don't."" During the Cold War that was a veiled threat that any 1945 deals were not set in stone."
Psy1,UkrainianConflict,2015-03-17 11:20,  I really think that the Russians aren’t the ones to lecture Ukraine and Ukrainians about fascism especially since they were the ones that signed the pact with the devil [Nazi Germany] and started World War II  The Molotov-Riptoven pact came as a reaction to the Munich agreement where the USSR was starting to worry France and Britain would sit and do nothing as Germany expanded eastward towards the USSR even if Germany expanded into the USSR.  The point of Molotov-Riptoven was to force Hitler to expand east into France so no mater what France and Britain would be forced to side against Hitler.   Stalin intended to break Molotov-Riptoven but didn't expect France to be defeated so quickly also records showed that Britain and France had no intention of defending Poland thus the Phoney War stage of WWII were France and Britain declared on Germany but neither launched any offensive against Germany as their long standing war plans going back to the 1920's were for them to wait for Germany to invade Belgium or France and their Generals always intended to let Germany push as far east as he wished.
