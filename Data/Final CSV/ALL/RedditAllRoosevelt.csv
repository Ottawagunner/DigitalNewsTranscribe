readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland  although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful  they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation  the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed  they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)   it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.

my_baby_ate_dingos,france,2015-03-17 12:59,J'ai en effet souvent dans l'idée qu'une 2e guerre mondiale finie en 1940 se solde invariablement par une guerre froide qui évolue en 3e guerre mondiale. Industrialisée  militarisée  avec Staline à sa tête  l'URSS était l'ennemi naturel de l'Europe de l'Est.  Sans alliance Allemagne-Japon  Roosevelt n'a aucune excuse pour pousser à une stricte alliance militaire avec la France et le Royaume-Uni après Pearl Harbor. Les US se lancent donc dans une guerre bilatérale contre le Japon. L'Europe de l'Est est libérée du Reich par les Occidentaux et non par les Rouges  donc pas de pacte de Varsovie.   Seulement  y'a encore des troupes russes en Pologne  et je pense pas que Staline aurait lâché ses gains territoriaux suite à l'invasion de 39 une fois l'Allemagne écroulée.  Avec Daladier et Chamberlain encore à la tête de la France et le Royaume-Uni  le pacifisme européen est encore vivace  mais sous cinq à dix ans la question polonaise finirait par relancer les machines de guerre. Surtout si les US finissent par battre le Japon (avec ou sans l'arme nucléaire  d'ailleurs) et menacent l'URSS à l'est.  Ca serait comme toute guerre au sol contre la Russie  une boucherie...

It grew out of rival [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism) ambitions of the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire) and the [Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan) over [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria) and [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea). The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria  specifically the area around the [Liaodong Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula) and [Mukden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden)  and the seas around Korea  Japan  and the [Yellow Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea).  &gt Russia sought a [warm water port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_water_port)  on the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean)  for their navy as well as for maritime trade. [Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok) was only operational during the summer season  but [Port Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCshunkou) was operational all year. From the end of the [First Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War) in 1903  negotiations between Russia and Japan had proved impractical. Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in Manchuria dating back to the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century. Through threat of Russian expansion  Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as in the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused this  farther demanding Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to its strategic interests and chose to go to war. After negotiations broke down in 1904  the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur  a naval base in Liaotung Province leased to Russia by China  in a surprise attack.  &gt The resulting campaigns  in which the Japanese military attained complete victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them  were unexpected by world observers. Over time  the consequences of these battles transformed the balance of power in East Asia  resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. Scholars today debate the historical significance of the Russo-Japanese War.  &gt Russia suffered numerous defeats at the hands of Japan and remained engaged in the war due in part to the will of the tsar  Nicholas II. After faring poorly early in the war  Nicholas II  convinced that Russia would ultimately obtain victory in the war  chose to remain engaged in the war  at first  to await the outcomes of certain naval battles  and later on  upon realizing imminent defeat  it has been debated  to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a ""humiliating peace"".

Sethdood,pics,2015-03-17 13:56,"I've lived in Flushing  Queens for my entire life. I can tell you that this disgusting ridiculous bullshit down near Main is absolutely no surprise. For those who don't know  downtown Flushing houses a massive pocket of Chinese immigrants  surrounded by a far-reaching (almost two-three towns wide) halo of Korean immigrants. Chinatown in Manhattan is really just a few dirty disgusting garbage packed streets  and if you want to see that type of low-class barbarism spread out a bit more  come to Flushing  where local authorities have been more lenient about letting them be themselves.   When I worked in Long Island City  I would spend an extra 5 dollars on travel to skip the worst part of my day: Walking just three blocks down Main Street to get to the 7 Train subway on Roosevelt Ave (where this picture was taken). Every few feet  there are piles and piles of black garbage bags  which is nice because at least sometimes the garbage makes it into a bag  but the stink coming from the pile is usually fucking revolting. The sidewalk and gutters are covered in grime and sludge  gross garbage juice which has just rotted and stained everything black. It's not uncommon to actually see dead fish on the floor  next to little glossy handouts for happy-ending massage parlors and crumpled wrappers. I always had to long-step over something nasty  every day. Not a single part of any of it it smells okay. Not a single part of it doesn't have a patina of purified waste covering it.   The sidewalk is where most of my attention is  because if I look up for too long I'd step in something gross  as stated. Aside from that  whats happening in the crowds is fuckin horrifying. EVERYONE does the thing where they loudly bring up phlegm and spit  it's fucking constant. Weird screaming in Chinese  awkward wails and complete lack of self awareness- check. Insanely rude bumping into you  getting in your way or otherwise hindering you- check. Shops with dead animals hanging in the window- check. The shopkeeps there clean their grimy dirty pissed on floors  and then just sloppily toss the mop bucket out the front door into the street  adding to the smell of everything else.  One time I turn a corner to get up the train station stairs  and sitting on a bottom step was some fucking gross toothless Chinese guy screaming something with his mouth FULL of Lo-mein  like not just full but with a fistfull of it just dangling out of his mouth looking like a noodle beard. Surrounding him on the stairs were flat  stepped on noodles which he already dropped  which everyone else has to walk on. I just said ""Ugh guy  what the fuck"" and went a different way. I'm positive he just left all of his garbage there and continued not to give a fuck.  And that's the problem  they somehow give zero fucks about how they come off doing disgusting shit. It's like when you see a movie taking place in the middle ages and everything is unsanitary and shit covered- it's modern day peasantry. Someone just took their pants off and shat in the street?! Yeah fucking OF COURSE he did. My friend linked me this picture without explanation and I responded with ""Um yeah that's definitely Roosevelt and Main."" Fuck that shit  and also  I don't want to go to China ever. "

whatdoesthedatasay,AskReddit,2015-03-17 15:54,"Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.      Women are more easily influenced by social and peer pressure  as evidenced by widespread conformity to standards of beauty and fashion  and enforce that conformity all on their own once it's been communicated to them.      The implementation and growth of the welfare state/social safety net  at least in the US where I'm from  correlates neatly with the introduction of women's suffrage. It's a nice idea  but it has irreparably bankrupted the entire western world. American social spending got its start with the New Deal  and Eleanor Roosevelt's success in getting women voters on board with the new normal of public-sector jobs and government stimulus spending was a major component of ever making that proto-socialist dream a reality. Women created the deficit  is what I'm trying to say.      On foreign policy  far too many women subscribe to the idea that not antagonizing a nation or group will turn them into dear little lambs. The result is the religiously held belief that the more moderate party should always back down in a tense military situation  because obviously the more belligerent party won't  and peace is the end objective. This is a suicidal idea. Not all women believe this  but too many do.      Bowing to female voices on campus speech  sexual harassment  and social justice issues - all areas in which females  in my experience  form a decisive majority of those engaged - has led to a more bitter  unpleasant  and restricted public sphere. Free speech is a thing of the past  you simply cannot say certain things (like ""women shouldn't vote"") and expect to keep your job  and it's social media and arts/entertainment mobs that are enforcing it  not ""traditionally patriarchal"" bodies like the government  police  schools  churches  or businesses.      All that said  I understand this makes me an asshole  ladies  and I eagerly await my double term in the coming social justice reconditioning camps. "

NovaNardis,offbeat,2015-03-17 16:24,I live in the same neighborhood I grew up in (moved back for law school).  I have mixed feelings about red light cams.  We have a good number on Roosevelt Boulevard  a twelve lane thruway that runs through largely residential areas of Philadelphia.  (Four physically divided segments of three lanes each  two in either direction.)  Two of the intersections near me (Red Lion and Grant Avenues) with the Boulevard were routinely rated among the Top 10 most dangerous in the US.  They've since been cammed  and speeding and running red lights has really plummeted.  Which is great.  On the other hand  a couple years ago a girl got in a drunk driving accident around the corner from me.  She hit a light post and her two passengers were killed.  The nearby light was subsequently replaced and in the name of safety a cam was put in.  The accident had nothing whatever to do with the light  and now the yellow light is remarkably shorter. That's clearly a revenue generating camera.  So  they can be used well.  That doesn't mean they always are.

The one Roosevelt uses here lived on as an affectation in early movies with sound. Up until about the 1950s everybody used the lockjaw affectation called a continental accent although a lot of those people actually talked that way like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. Pierre Elliot Trudeau had a similar accent but his son does not.
kingofeggsandwiches,todayilearned,2015-03-17 10:08,"You mean like when Truman fucked the British and Canadians out of their own research? The research they'd sent their best scientists to work on and provided the research basis for by ""losing"" the document Roosevelt had signed before he died agreeing to share whatever progress the Manhattan project made in return for all the the prior research the British and Canadians had made designing nuclear weapons and the assistance of the scientists assigned to those projects?

CheesusRice,politics,2015-03-17 10:24,This is like an episode of House of Cards.  I don't know if I have been psychologically primed to make certain connections now or I have a different way of thinking with exposure to hypothetical albeit realistic political actions.  The connections I see is that certain states are lobbying for this because the state level government knows that it will create a burden and therefore have to sell to private investors to ease the tax cost thus companies can use the land for private interest.  In my mind it makes sense because until this proposal was made I have never heard of the national park system being an issue.  It was always praised as this awesome thing the Teddy Roosevelt created.  
DimeShake,CitiesSkylines,2015-03-17 10:36,I thought it was Teddy Roosevelt.

nathanmasse,TimeTravelWhatIf,2015-03-17 10:55,Well I assume you're also implying that the population infrastructure and military equipment are also transfers back in time.    There are two scenarios: 1) Germany realizes they've been sent back immediately (without launching the invasion of Poland) and 2) They are unaware and invade Poland assuming they're still in 1939. Honestly I don’t think that we need to delve into the specifics of each example because in either event Germany would eventually realize something had happened as they blitz across Poland and find none of the resistance they expected or just when the Germany population tunes in with their radios and find that almost none of the non-German stations are active. Either way within a matter of days Germany has realized it’s in 1919.  Regardless of which scenario is the case there are a few facts we can establish: 1) Germany is the most technologically advanced nation on the planet by far  2) Germany is the most populous *stable* country in Europe twice the population of France or UK at the time  and 3) The rest of Europe is still devastated from the Great War and would be in no position to (truly) resist in any capacity.  I honestly can’t think of what would make Hitler happier at this point in his life than to be in 1919 and see the looks on the diplomats’ faces as he explains what the Treaty of Versailles (which they just passed two months ago) had done and how he and still managed to make Germany the 1939 juggernaut it would appear to be.  Obviously he would embellish the story and whatnot but that’s neither here nor there.  It would be simple enough for Hitler to demonstrate the force at his disposal by launching a coordinated air attack on Paris (or London!) or simple sending his wolfpacks out and putting the UK in a stranglehold.  He may simply decide (since he is staunchly anti-communist to nip the Bolshevik Movement in the butt and successfully occupy Western Russia. No matter how he shows it Germany would become the dominant force in Europe without a doubt but that’s just Europe.   The US has risen from the ashes of the Great War relatively unscathed and if anything far more powerful.  In just a few months they had learned many of the tricks and tactics it had taken the European countries years and millions of men to develop. The country had been pulled from a recession and was now boom quite nicely.  But they would most certainly see Germany for what it was the greatest threat to America that had ever surfaced.  Not the kind of threat that Japan was (“oh dear they might take some of our islands”) but a true existential thread.   And then there’s Japan who also rose from the ashes of the Great War with nothing but good things to say about it.  They are isolated enough from Europe and America that I don’t expect their behavior to change drastically from our current time with the possible exception that they may grab some French and UK territories sooner.  The only way I could see Japan being a deciding factor in this future is if they ally themselves with one of the other powers.    In our timeline the US in the 1920’s really doesn’t consider military advancement a priority.  They had just helped in ‘The War to End All Wars’ so why invest in better tank designs or more powerful aircraft engines when the ones you have work just fine in peacetime?  Well in this new timeline the US is under no illusions that there will be another war  Germany’s throwing its weight around and stomping out any resistance to their dominance of Europe and the US would be able to tell that it was only a matter of time until Germany decided Europe was big enough and wanted to hop across the pond. A fierce self-reliant militarism would crop up in the US (likely lead by Theodor Roosevelt) and rather than being isolationist it would be defencivist. It would seem likely that with the proper coxing and possible a few stolen technologies from Germany that they could reach 1941 military potential by the end of 1930.  Meanwhile Germany would be basking in their superiority (both militarily and perceived racially) and I would expect their military and scientific industry to flounder somewhat.  It’s human nature to work more slowly when there’s less external pressure and to work at a feverish pace when your life is in the balance.   As a result I would estimate that the US and Germany would likely develop nuclear capability with a few years (1935-1939) of each other and for there to be a three-way cold war between Japan the US and Germany.  Japan would develop nukes later presumably in the 1950's after it has consolidated its hold of China Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.  From there I can’t say any number of things could happen and diplomatic standoffs between three powers are likely to be more volatile than when it’s just two.
