Look at propaganda pictures of Stalin Mao and Kim. The resemblance            
in hell will you ask Stalin "are you fucking sorry??"Well            
children? that obama is channeling stalin through a ouija board? no

just gave you an example. Stalin killed more people than Hitler            
the votes decide everything. - Joesph Stalin Maybe we're just using different            
either through things like atheist Stalin or cult-like Hitler or in            
freedoms at that time.Yep Stalin is just like someone who            
even Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin because no matter what you            
maniac yet you defended both Stalin and Mao. Would you care            
form your psychiatric evaluations? Thanks Stalin .I have some criticism for            
your response to /u/Joseph_ Stalin _ a lot more the winner            
different sense. If Hitler or Stalin had nuclear weapons the entirety            
no small part due to Stalin replacing the incompetent Voroshilov with            
now literally as bad as Stalin for having told him something            
to hear.He should stop Stalin and get to the point

PoC in the past and Stalin used calls for the good            
fucking orders from Adolph God Stalin ? You people are worse than            
eg. Kulaks Party members like Stalin rose to the top of            
by Russians but by Georgia stalin was Georgian not Russian its

wall and shot.no worry stalin here nowThis is the            
up there with things like Stalin and green beans as the

I wish the Trotsky-loving "kill Stalin " liberals on this sub would            
what Trotsky argued for not Stalin until later Stalin realized that            
for not Stalin until later Stalin realized that Trotsky was right            
easily imagine it. How did Stalin handle dissent in his country            
us is being very naive. Stalin and Stalinist rulers distorted communism            
up by the USSR under Stalin and some rulers were even            
were even directly hand-picked by Stalin such as Kim Il-sung. Instead            
rightfully deserves specially the bloody Stalin times but after that it's            
support of the infrastructure. Like Stalin ruled from 30 way to            
and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee            
post-WW2 USSR were made by Stalin a certified lunatic and a            
World_War)).Israel is jewish Stalin killed jews. That's why he            
he hats Israel and loves Stalin Based on some posthumous rehabilitative            
they made up about how Stalin wouldn't have sent the tanks            
between Mormonism and Eastern Orthodox. Stalin I can't comment on the            
The Castros are still alive. Stalin was 74. Molotov nearly outlived            
Like my hero /u/Joseph_ Stalin _ I'm certain I have this            
ones this time. How did Stalin handle dissent in his country            
was worse than Pol Pot Stalin Mao and Saddam Hussien combined            
but he ended up scaring Stalin with his (Hitler) heavy handed            
pure fucking evil.Uh but Stalin used atheism to fuel some            
But as GGG went full Stalin mode on any client modifications            
http://i.imgur.com/FehecK0.jpg) Trotsky-loving "kill Stalin " liberals I don't think someone            
all have a last meal. " Stalin dies after eating toast"HA            
you include Mao Hitler or Stalin . There are also trends in            
the Piedmont Strategy failed and Stalin became more distrustful of the            
bad "proof of communisms failure" Stalin .Jesus d0pe. There is no            
regarding naming a team but Stalin has had to undo name            
a hole of self destruction. Stalin anyone? So thats where Stalinwood            
get Marx Engels Lenin &amp Stalin tattooed on their chest in            
a choice between Hitler and Stalin is well beyond that point            
weren't even the Hitler or Stalin ASCII. Anyway surely it couldn't            
basically the flipside of what Stalin did the Crimean Tatars). Of

Cincinnatus than the Hitler or Stalin . I just think the majority            
like you so shut up!" Stalin would be proud! Id like            
on the corruption of Lenin Stalin or any other Soviet leader            
them for hundreds of years. Stalin routinely carried out horrid policies            
shit they were kept secret. Stalin was probably a bigger cunt            
invade Poland. Hitler allied with Stalin briefly to split Poland but            
but they weren't friendly with Stalin who they knew was a            
Before Germany invaded the USSR Stalin was hoping the western powers            
a woman. It looks like Stalin simply understood that they didn't            
careless he was and then Stalin took power and well... This            
a more valuable job.No Stalin I ain't Stalin.So much            
job.No StalinI ain't Stalin .So much of the denial

therefore all Catholics are Hitler. Stalin was an atheist therefore all

don't give no fuck. They're Stalin . "You are in my way            
the marxist worst case is stalin or mao. Regardless it's worse            
under Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin or even the internment of

the canal?You forgot Stalin. Stalin was a real asshole. Yep            
think the line attributed to Stalin makes good sense here "no            
the likes of Hitler and Stalin who had very "simplistic" solutions            
would tat Lenin and &amp Stalin around vital organs to prevent            
prevent critical damage during beatings... Stalin Che and ol'Castro. I got            
can even try to beat Stalin and his red guard he            
from the depths of nell Stalin did the ethical cleansing the            
the preparations for nothing... Well Stalin did manage to brainwash a            
stay as far away from Stalin as I can get. You're            
counter-revolutionary to Marxist aims. [As Stalin wrote](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive

to tell me is that Stalin didn't skin kittens alive for

I won't say much about Stalin other than he represented the
