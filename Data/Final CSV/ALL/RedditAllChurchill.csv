readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland  although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful  they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation  the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed  they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)   it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.

Phoenixf1zzle,cigars,2015-03-17 12:10,I was in the same boat as you a couple years ago. Brought back cigars from overseas and didn't humidify them. Left some Uppmans in a ziploc  some Siglo I's in their tubos and the same with the RyJ Churchills.  The ziploc sticks dried up  the cohibas either dried up or were not smoked properly. Even in their tubos they dried up.  Luckily  the back of the shelf was oddly humid and so without that  I think my churchills would've dried up in their tubos. Luckily they didn't dry up and I smoked the churchills a whole year later  they were perfect.  Anyway  not wanting to repeat any of this  I got my tupperdor going.
cefgaw,politics,2015-03-17 12:17,It comes from Churchill's speech.  [A government minister had incautiously referred to this period of inaction as “years that the locusts had eaten.”](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/414471/americas-locust-years-jim-talent).  The NRO article is clearer and less bombastic argument for increase in military spending.  Though it also only talks about U.S. military spending less than what it was rather than lower than any other country.  Military spending has been reduced due to 2011 Budget Control Act  not in-action.  So I still don't see the Churchill parrallel.  The way Cotton uses it  it sounds like he's calling anyone getting government assitance as a locust.
daledinkler,canada,2015-03-17 12:25,"Oh  well  that settles it.  We should accept the opinions of people writing at the tail end of the 19th century as the basis for our 21st century political discourse.  While we're at it  why don't we use this quote as well to strip women of their rights?  ""The women's suffrage movement is only the small edge of the wedge  if we allow women to vote it will mean the loss of social structure and the rise of every liberal cause under the sun. Women are well represented by their fathers  brothers  and husbands.""  Winston Churchill"
AvatarOfMomus,WorldofTanks,2015-03-17 12:31,I wouldn't say the 12t is worst in class  simply because the 59-16 and MT-25 are still a thing  and whatever you say about the 12t the gun is at least half decent for close to medium range work.  Basically the 12t has stats it can work with  and a good player can make the tank work well because it has speed and a decent gun  even if it's no T37. The BDR on the other hand has nothing but its gun to work with and almost everything else about the tank is working against it or doesn't help much  especially when it's not top tier.  The BDR is also competing with some very good tanks too. The KVs are all great  the Churchill 1 has a pretty good gun too even if the armor is crap  and the tracks are better trolls than those on the BDR. The T1 Heavy at least has a decent gun and good gun depression  along with fantastic mobility. That pretty much leaves the Premium tanks  which are supposed to be worse than the regular ones  and the VK 30.01 H  which is at least a smaller target than the BDR with a good gun.
CharlieMinimum,canada,2015-03-17 12:56,Winston Churchill was one of the great minds of the 20th century.    He was right about Islam the same way he was right about Nazi Germany.  He was right about the eventual effects of women's suffrage  except that women  of course  had every right to take part in the democratic process.  Muslims do NOT have a right to move into the west.
cigarQ,cigars,2015-03-17 13:03,My vote is for Churchills  it seems like the best venue  but I'm open to wherever. 
CharlieMinimum,canada,2015-03-17 13:07,You need to grow a sense of history.  The 19th century was just yesterday.  I lived at the same time Churchill did.  What did Churchill say about Islam that was incorrect?
FromLionstoLambs,WorldOfWarships,2015-03-17 13:07,&gt  How stupid... they'll ignore the UK and implement an almost fictitious Russian navy?  Let's not forget what country Wargaming takes pride in. Although Russia didn't have any naval battles that were more notable than any of the USN  RN  IJN or Kriegsmarine they did have a surface and submarine fleet. England and the US even leased Russia ships much like the lend lease versions of the Valentine and Churchill tanks. So don't be surprised if we get a premium HMS Royal Sovereign (renamed Arkhangelsk) and USS Milwaukee (renamed Murmansk).

Theoroshia,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:20,changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us - are you sure you're being non-biased?
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:34,"I guess you could say that but I belive that was the case. France and Great Britain were to attack Germany right away should they invade Poland. Before the attack took place Marshall Piłsudski insisted that Poland and France should make preventive invasion of Germany due to them ignoring Treaty of Versailles conditions which were dismissed by France. After Germany invaded Poland all that Western Allies did was declare war and take no military action. Everyone in Poland was sure that they only need to hold the invasion for a short time to stall German offensive allowing France and Britain to take necessary action. After Poland was defeated the government on the exile created Polish forces which fought extraordinary in various battles during the war. Battle of Britain was won thanks to Polish and Czechoslovakian pilots (""Never  in the field of human conflict  was so much owed by so many to so few."" was the words Churchill said after victory). They also fought in Arnhem (6. SBS led by General Sosabowski)  in Narvik (1. Polish Independent Highland Brigade)  Tobruk (3. Polish Carpathian Infantry Division) and Falaise (1. Armoured Division led by General Maczek). The fought alongside the very people who betrayed their beloved country because they belived that they won't betray them again. They fought to the very end without knowing that the decision to hand Poland to the eastern bloc under russian rule was already made during Yalta Conference. After this all  don't you think that betrayal is the correct used word here?"

godfasha123,todayilearned,2015-03-17 14:14,Huh  interesting - seems Churchill always held a very aggressive stance against the Soviet Union.
drakk0n,horseracing,2015-03-17 14:33,"Not every racetrack can be a Santa Antia or Churchill - in fact these pictures of Aqueduct adequately represent the majority of track buildings I've been to - or actually it looks quite a bit better than most tracks I've been to.

Busho123,chess,2015-03-17 15:12,Nice.   If you're going through hell  keep going.  Winston Churchill  
uppermiddleclasss,syriancivilwar,2015-03-17 15:16,Who does he think he is in that comparison? Churchill  Stallin  or FDR?
mistersunshin,WorldofTanks,2015-03-17 15:49,Prepare for quote tower of doom.  &gt I'm going to start off by saying that my problem with the tank isn't when it's top tier. You can do well in almost any tank when you're top tier  even the AMX 40 simply because half the field can't pen the damned thing.  How is the AMX 40 relevant to the conversation? Very few tanks have armor that works against a higher tier than they are. Many don't have enough armor to protect them from low tiers  the BDR does  and that's worth something. The BDR *is*  however  easily the strongest of the tier 5 heavies when bottom tier. Armor is irrelevant and they're all slow  so the only differentiating factor is the gun. It's the only one that has both enough pen and alpha to genuinely threaten tier sevens.   &gt The hull hitbox actually extends out into the tracks  and the tracks themselves only offer minimal protection of that hitbox. If someone fires high or low into the tracks they'll eat the shot but if you're side-scraping they can just shoot into the front of the track and pen with ~100mm of penetration. Also that auto-bounce zone is tiny compared to the rest of the tank  and anyone manually aiming will just aim between the massive turret and the equally massive flat front of the upper hull.  I have never found this to be a serious problem  either on this tank or on the Churchills. You will personally encounter someone who knows this and has the skills and opportunity to take advantage of it *maybe* once every ten games. When you do you simply use your kit on your tracks and change your approach.   That the autobounce zone is roughly a quarter of it's frontal hull and is dead center of mass  at a tier where guns with worse than .4 accuracy are the norm. The LFG is steeply angled enough to be a bounce even dead on. That leaves the strip between the two  and the upper glacis as valid targets  which is half of the hull at most.  &gt No  both in stats and in practice the KV-1 is at worst dead even with the BDR  and at best has better terrain resistance values and a better top speed  even if it loses out marginally in engine power. The deficit in top speed means that the KV-1 starts slowing down later  meaning the deficit in engine power matters less.  Alright  on hard terrain their acceleration is roughly equivalent  one gets 20% better specific horsepower  the other gets 20% better terrain resistance. On medium terrain  where one spends the *vast majority of one's time*  both tanks have the same terrain resistance so the BDR wins out significantly. On soft terrain  which is rare and typically a death sentence to enter  the KV has a small advantage.  All of this is acceleration only.  The KV climbs hills slower  turns and maneuvers slower  and can't hit it's supposed top speed without both favorable terrain and a 15+ second runup. The BDR turns fast enough to keep it's gun on a circling medium  the KV doesn't. Given all that  and having driven both of them within the last day  it is absolutely clear to me that the BDR has better overall mobility than the KV.  &gt Which is a good thing because it doesn't have the accuracy to aim for weak-points  and it has a 10 second reload putting its overall DPS as the lowest of any Tier 5 Heavy tank  even the Premiums.  Considering I can and do aim for and hit weakpoints in it every single time I drive it  I have no idea where that's coming from. Stock reload is 9.1 seconds  not ten  and mine is eight seconds flat with vents and a rammer. DPM is technically the lowest  but the gap isn't very big  and TTK is comparable because of the head start 240 gives you. This is ignoring both overmatch possibilities and the simple advantage that having best-in-tier alpha gives you for trading. It has the best firepower in class/tier by a mile  the tier five tanks that have more are all turretless TDs.  &gt Which beats the hell out of the BDR  whose only useful armor is whatever you can turn into an auto-bounce zone at the time. Also the lower plate is at an auto-bounce angle  so basically the entire front of the hull is good  which is better than the VK  M6  or T-150  though the turret is still lousy.  Which happens to be a significant portion of the tank. The fact that the frontal hull is actually pretty well armored just encourages people to shoot at your paper turret. It also has the same hull-behind-track issue that is apparently a big deal on the BDR. At long ranges the Arl's armor is passable  at close range it's pretty bad and you shouldn't expect much out of it. When a tier 6 heavy has to worry about a derp Hetzer firing AP  it does not get to claim to be well armored.  &gt That top 90mm has the best penetration in tier though  and better penetration that most guns a tier higher  to the point that it barely has to aim at a T-150 to penetrate it from the front. The Accuracy is also equal to the M6 and KV-85 (with the 100mil) even though the soft stats are worse.  Its also easily the worst choice of gun for the tank. It has *excessive* pen in that it trades away every other stat that matters to get it. It has bad dpm and bad functional accuracy because of the appallingly bad handling and aimtime  while only having passable alpha. It takes more time and exposure to put a round on target with this thing than it does with an *IS*. Even a KV-2 is arguably better in this regard because even it has better soft stats and only has to hit the target. All for 240 measly damage. You only pick this gun if you're too poor to ever carry a single prem round. The other guns have their issues  but the DCA45 is a bad gun on this tank.  &gt It ends up with better armor than the Tiger 1  and the same squishy turret half the Heavies at that tier have. The mobility and gun depression are still better than the BDR's  and combined with the fantastic pen and decent accuracy on the gun mean that it can still do something in higher tier matches.  No  it really doesn't. The only usable piece of armor on either of these tanks besides their only-thick-enough-to-not-be-overmatched sides is the Tiger's turret face.  The Tiger can hide it's hull and be *somewhat* safe  the M4 just gets penned. Its pen is  again  the gun's (and the tank's  actually) only virtue. Still got bad bloom stats  still got bad aimtime compared to it's damage  still got last-in-class dpm which is a big deal on this tank  unlike on the BDR  because it's alpha damage is so weak. You will lose a slugging match with an *E25* because of your bad dpm  low hp  and non-existent armor. Its mobility is better than the BDR's  but its not significantly better than that of the M4 45's *peers*. Gun depression is largely wasted because of it's giant paper turret and long exposure times. It will also screw you over in a brawl because it drops to one lousy degree outside of your front 160  on a tall tank no less. Lastly  132 pen on a tier 5 is every bit as useful as 212 on a tier 7  to say nothing of the proportionally better alpha on the BDR.  &gt Believe it or not I'm not a shit player. I've got a 57% win rate in the thing with 40 battles  I just don't find the tank fun. I even like the VK better than the BDR because for whatever reason it's just not as frustrating to drive  especially when I'm not top tier. I'm happy that you like the tank but I just don't. It's frustrating  it's not fun  and that has nothing to do with how good the gun is and everything to do with how crap everything else about the tank is  especially when it's not top tier.  I don't think you were a shit player. French tanks are... weird  and you're obviously new to them. There's nothing else in the game that plays quite like them  and their strengths and weaknesses are less obvious than other nations (save possibly the Brits) because they're based on the emergent properties of several of the tank's stats in combination  they only become clear by playing them. There's nothing wrong with not *getting* them.  In the case of the BDR you clearly don't understand how to make the tank work if  in your own words  you struggle to do more than two shots of damage a game and think it's bad bottom tier. As an aside  there are two things that can make a tank work bottom tier: mobility and firepower. Heavies in general don't have the former  and the BDR has the latter in spades. It is *easily* the best tier 5 heavy bottom tier  it's not even a contest. You haven't even played the tanks that follow.  My offer stands. Incidentally  I got my first Poole's medal in any tank in the BDR last night in an 11-15 loss (only took me 12k battles  such a scrub). Already had two Radley's in the BDR  I am never selling it.

stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill  Roosevelt  Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/).

Are they at the top of  or have they significantly contributed towards their field or subject on a world wide level (Tim Berners-Lee  Isaac Newton etc)3. Are they borderline/full on creepy  and  in about 20 years time  likely to be convicted for sexual assault or much  much worse (Jimmy Savile  Rolf Harris and Cliff Richard is on the fence)

theoriginaltoolio,casualiama,2015-03-17 18:19,I'm on an icebreaker. its 2 degrees Fahrenheit  a bit chilly  just sweater weather. I'm here breaking ships out of the ice so commerce by sea can continue on the eastern coast of Canada can continue throughout the winter. In the summer months we will go up north. I'm 26  27 in less then a week. Do these best and worst things have to be ship related? Best on ship  going to Churchill Manitoba and seeing hundreds of beluga whales breaching the water all around the ship. Worst on ship  eating poached salmon in rough seas and being seasick. I can't stand the smell of salmon to this day. (it happened 7ish years ago) Best overall  probably the whale thing  but being hit on by an Indonesian hooker was pretty cool too  until i found out she was a hooker. Worst overall  Walking into a scene an ex set up to make me think she committed suicide. turned out to be razor burn on her wrists mixed with water to make it look much worse then it was. One billion dollars? i don't need near that much. a small 2 story cabin  rustic on the outside and modern on the inside  with walk in fridge and freezer so i don't have to go into town too often. A huge library and entertainment system  and a little steel row boat that i can take on the lake and have a few beer at the end of the day. maybe a Garage so i can try to build the iron man suit...... I can't change my own brakes  but i think i have a fair shot at building the suit.  I apologize for any and all typo's  I'm not the best speller.
LittleDevil1,unitedkingdom,2015-03-17 18:48,The European commision put more effort into protecting border trade when historically Britain has always done better with other markets  remember Churchill said something along the lines of we must always chose the seas over Europe.   Even if we left the EU  which is not what we are talking about here we would be able to get a free trade deal with Europe  we are France's and Germany's biggest export market  with the amount of lobbying that happens within the EU theres no way those markets would want to lose us  also we'd then be able to make our own trade deals.   I don't think trade or common market should have anything to do with free movement  it should have to do with compatibility of cultures.
BatmanClubSandwich,todayilearned,2015-03-17 19:17,&gt  I don't think a male would be so pilloried.  When Winston Churchill was informed that two of his male staffers were caught in public having sex in the park (as homosexuality was illegal at the time of WW2)  he congratulated them for being able to brave the cold. 
pgmog,BipolarReddit,2015-03-17 19:23,"I worked for a ""big pharma"" company for two years on the data side of drug discovery. I know the drill. I'm very familiar with its shortcomings and limitations  but as Churchill said ""Democracy is the worst form of government  except all the rest that have been tried."" That's how I feel about Western medicine.  You know what else has proven antioxidant  antiinflammatory  and anti-convulsant properties? Melatonin. Good ol' *aux naturale* Melatonin! A hormone found in abundance nearly in every living creature. Perfectly legal and available OTC at the Rite Aid/CVS near you. Why not decry the under-use of melatonin in current available treatment? Because it's simply not sexy enough for you to latch onto. It doesn't have quiet the same panache of an acrimonious battle between the East against the West (I know which side I'm on...). If it were illegal in the states we would have the exact same discussion about it right now. Convince me that CBD is superior to melatonin in treating BP and epilepsy.  Your reasoning is so riddled with fallacies I'm not sure where to start.  1) Okay there is not enough research on CBD. So  because we don't know enough about it  it must mean that it is better somehow? Splain'  2) Cannabis is thousands of years old. Alcohol is even older  ancient in fact (it's mentioned in the Bible!). Alcohol has strongly proven antiinflammatory properties in moderate amounts. So according to your logic alcohol should be used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis? Wut.  3) The polio vaccine is also in its infancy as medicine for human consumption. Didn't make it any less effective...and there sure as shit wasn't anything in Eastern medicine that could be used to even start to mimick its effects. Old is not always good. New is not always bad. Conclusion: it's not the time a substance has been used that counts  but rather the time it has been **scientifically** observed. Prescience time are like dog years to post-science time.  4) Modern Western research may be laughable to you  but *it's the best game in town*. You can justifiably sneer at the sorry state of humanity  but this is the best thing we have to offer. The only alternatives are hearsay and superstitions.   5) University funded studies are superior I agree of which there are many that have been done on Lithium.  6) This is simply nonsense. What a ""drug does"" can always be broken down to its desirable (effects) and undesirable (side-effects) parts. If it has no undesirable effects  then it has no side-effects. These are just really basic a priori definitions there  nothing really to contend. What are you saying? Eastern medicine consists of drugs that only have desirable effects. What fallacy?  7) Instead of pointing out the fallacy here  let me just make a slight adjustment to what you already wrote:  &gt  Again  I'm not suggesting anyone here try any of this for themselves  I'm simply stating that from a chemical standpoint we know what *Melatonin* is capable of  and we know it is non-lethal with a lower side effect profile then Lithium. We also know it has neuroprotective properties  anticonvulsant properties  and antioxidant properties. As a compound  *Melatonin* is already what it is.  Hmmmm......  "
Edward_Elgar,ukpolitics,2015-03-17 19:24,Eh  it really isn't that different. Music  language and certain social behaviors have certainly changed in that time  famous Winston Churchill noted that. However  the Britons of the 60s  50s  40s ect would still be recognizably British today. They would probably have more socially conservative values (which still exist today) and some homophobic and racist values (which are nearly dead)  but they would mostly be recognizably British and probably more religious too. 
alshifm,worldnews,2015-03-17 19:45,Germany’s unforgivable crime before WW2 was its attempt to loosen its economy out of the world trade system and to build up an independent exchange system from which the world-finance couldn’t profit anymore. ...We butchered the wrong pig.  -Winston Churchill

If you're talking about mein kampf it's pretty widely agreed that the way it's written is basically a big morass of nonsense. I have no idea how it got popular but it was all bullshit.  Also it's not a smart idea to go to war with a superpower and two pre superpowers even more so when you've started to lose a lot of battles.   And then there's getting mad at Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin and calling them Jews because they went against you and/or beat you in battle.

InfoTroll4Hire,Documentaries,2015-03-17 9:54,Your welcome Lenin Jr. Report all you want you national socialist Nazi. why don't you record my whole post on ELS so that the brain-dead mods that lurk there can get an education.   I noticed they don't even like the history that isn't controversial. Your sub is populated by some real dummies:  &gt &gt VoteRonaldRayGun 1 point 1 day ago   &gt &gt Wait wait wait... so German Imperialists who started WWI destroying Germany's assets is somehow communism's fault?  &gt Me:  &gt A major cause of WW1 was resentment towards Germany because they were a rising export superpower in Europe and rivalry with Russia after the Bolshevik revolution. Jewish Bolsheviks killed well over 20million people during the communist revolutions of the early 1900s-1917 (Lenin was also a Jew and a communist as was Trotsky who was living in NY prior to the communist revolution in Russia which was financed by Wall St. [Jacob Schiff provided the Bolsheviks with an estimated $20million in gold] 85% of the Bolsheviks were Jews and anyone who opposed them was either executed or thrown into a gulag forced labor camp to die). Germany was allied with Austria-Hungary whose Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbia which was allied with Russia (because they resented Austria-Hungary's absorption of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 when the Ottoman Empire's control of the Balkans collapsed that was home to a substantial Serb population) which started the war (in the Corfu Declaration in 1917 the Serbian government officially declared its intention to form a state of Yugoslavia). The European Allied countries (mainly Britain) responded to Germany's defense of Austria-Hungary with a blockade of Germany from 1914-1919. France declared war on Germany after Germany declared war on Russia after Russia invaded east Prussia. Germany invaded Belgium (allied with Britain) after they refused them safe passage. By 1916 not a single shot had been fired on German soil but France and Britain were devastated. Germany offered peace terms to let everything be as it was before the war with no changes in territory.  &gt Let's not forget that the Bolsheviks succeeded in destroying Germany in WW2 and dividing it along the Berlin Wall dubbed the Iron Curtain by Winston Churchill. As soon as Hitler was removed east Germany fell under Soviet control.  [deleted]  You people are pathetic can't even hold a decent argument so can only attempt to suppress contradicting information. No wonder you all hate free speech.  I await for ELS to launch their Jihad against Winston Churchill who called the Jews nothing less than traitors to all their host countries and plead with them to change their treasonous ways:   &gt Winston Churchill published an article in the Illustrated Sunday Herald on this date in 1920 titled “Zionism versus Bolshevism” in which he called upon the Jews a “people of peculiar genius” **to opt for being “national Jews” not “international Jews” i.e. communists — “world-wide conspirators for the overthrow of civilization** and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality.” “The conflict between good and evil which proceeds unceasingly in the breast of man” wrote Churchill “nowhere reaches such an intensity as in the Jewish race. The dual nature of mankind is nowhere more strongly or more terribly exemplified. We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind . . . And it may well be that this same astounding race may at the present time be in the actual process of producing another system of morals and philosophy as malevolent as Christianity was benevolent which if not arrested would shatter irretrievably all that Christianity has rendered possible. It would almost seem as if the gospel of Christ and the gospel of Antichrist were destined to originate among the same people  and that this mystic and mysterious race had been chosen for the supreme manifestations both of the divine and the diabolical.”  &gt “The struggle which is now beginning between the Zionist and Bolshevik Jews is little less than a struggle for the soul of the Jewish people.” —Winston Churchill  ................. &gt http://www.fpp.co.uk/bookchapters/WSC/WSCwrote1920.html &gt International Jews  &gt In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most if not all of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx and down to Trotsky (Russia) Bela Kun (Hungary) Rosa Luxembourg (Germany) and Emma Goldman (United States) this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality has been steadily growing. It played as a modern writer Mrs. Webster has so ably shown a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century  and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.  &gt Terrorist Jews  &gt There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews it is certainly a very great one  it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin a pure Russian is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky or of Zinovieff the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd) or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent if not indeed the principal part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria) so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing.

GI_Jack,Cyberpunk,2015-03-17 10:34,"&gt It is very hard to show that any new form of government is superior to that practiced now. It is even harder to show that any new form of government is superior to any practiced ever.  I think its safe to say I stoppped taking him serious at the first paragraph. While the second sentence is obviously true does anyone really believe that our current government(USA) is *really* the best we could think of? I for one thing we could have a unicarmel legislature ballot iniatives recall elections and of course proportional representation. Like this do other places in the world and like we have locally in some states.  &gt And perhaps of course it is. I mean even Churchill - hardly history's picture of a democrat - said ""democracy is the worst possible form of government except for all the others.""  &gt Of course Churchill also drank a fifth of Scotch every day. Perhaps he was drunk. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps he was lying. Perhaps he was both wrong and lying. Perhaps he was so lying so wrong and so drunk that he actually turned out to be right  Not mentioned is Churchill's outright support for mousolini up until he became the enemy. No Churchhill was a died in wool Tory and *fucking hated* every bit of populist rule. Of course we could talk about his drinking.  &gt  On the other hand if you can't just agree that Nazism and Communism were nasty you must get water on the brain every time it rains.   Stunning critique of other systems. Though provoking. Defiant. Totally reliant on public perception of various systems as spoon fed through propaganda and watered down grade school explinations re-amplified with hyperbolic language.  So after about 5 paragraphs of fluff about lamenting between two false choices we get to this:  &gt Let's start with my ideal world - the world of thousands preferably even tens of thousands of neocameralist city-states and ministates or neostates. The organizations which own and operate these neostates are for-profit sovereign corporations or sovcorps. For the moment let's assume a one-to-one mapping between sovcorp and neostate.  Feudalism worked so well the first time around. If you want to know how this turns out look at every time this has been tried in modern history. Pullman car company comes to mind. What you have is zero freedom and workers getting paid in script instead of real money so they can't leave(because they don't have any real money) and the company uses edifices of the state such as police spies propaganda to keep the workers in line for an ever decreasing paycheck.  &gt Residents fit into two classes: patron and dependent. Dependents are not legally responsible and are under the authority of their patrons. There is no dependent without patron although subcorps or suborgs may act as patrons. The neocameralist state is not a charitable organization but it has no reason not to tolerate a genuinely apolitical charity.  lets re-introduce serfdom while we are at it.  &gt The business of a sovcorp is to make money by deterring aggression. Since human aggression is a serious problem preventing it should be a good business.   Throw in for for-profit law enforcement.  &gt Moreover the existence of unprofitable governments in your vicinity is serious cause for concern because unprofitable governments tend to have strange decision structures and do weird dangerous things.  damn commies. I mean like lets invade them and make them all serfs and then we can force them to be profitable.  &gt The joint-stock model is hundreds of years old. It is as proven as proven can be. Anyone who questions its potency in producing profit and annihilating waste and graft might as well believe in the international Jewish conspiracy while they're at it.  jew-baiting now? The joint-stock model hasn't been considered ""mainstream"" since around 1910 before then it was considered irreptuable. Its instability and waste are unquestionable and its inherent flawedness has been evidence from the first stock market crash to everytime wages get cut while profits soar and we cannot do anything about it.  This is certainly ""cyber-punk"" as its certainly dystopian enough to fit in as a plot element in a really good cyberpunk novel(or movie). But the point of cyberpunk as well as most dystopiast fiction is to warn the reader about the dangers of this possible outcome not to hearld in the fail.  I have to ask why have you decided to revive every fail idea since before the 19th century."
