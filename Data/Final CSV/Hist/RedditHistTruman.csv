The Soviet Union under the ideology of Stalinism wanted a worldwide communist revolution because only then would there be a proletariat state without class struggle and maintained by class equality and socialism. This ideology conflicted with the Americans. The U.S. believed that capitalism but not necessarily pure capitalism was the most functional model of economics. Communism is a direct rejection of capitalism. Communists believed that in order to constructed a pure communist world the proletariat must rise against capitalists destroy capitalism and develop a purely proletariat state. Ideologically this is a threat to the U.S.. American-Soviet ambassador George Kennan warned President Truman about the Soviet's masterplan. Kennan thought the Soviet ideology was a threat to traditional American ideals and a poor representation of the Russian people's beliefs. Moreover he believed that the Soviet government was oppressive regime with a delusional philosophy. Truman took Kennan's advise and established his Truman Doctrine which warned the American people about the Soviet's totalitarian ideology.  National ideology however was not the only reason the U.S. joined in the Vietnam War. It may be the main reason but the U.S. also faced a lot of domestic political pressure in its decision to fight and remain in a war against the Vietcong. 
Arebos,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:14,One of the main reasons I can think of would be his relief of General Douglas MacArthur.  MacArthur was a very popular general and national hero during WWII who helped turn the battle in the pacific around after being pushed out of the Philippians.  He was also a distinguished soldier and leader during WWI.  He was even considered a political candidate during the 1940's elections.    However during the push back against the North Korean invasion MacArthur went against express orders in several respects and invaded the North thus instigating Chinese involvement.   Truman removed MacArthur from command in Korea thus receiving a huge political backlash of public support for the decision. He decided not to even run for reelection.   Casey Steven (2008).

stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
beatles-in-space,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 19:00,President Truman had an ambitious domestic agenda which he called the Fair Deal which stalled in front of a Republican-controlled Congress. In the 1948 campaign he ran against the do-nothing Congress which turned out to be a successful political strategy although it didn't improve his legislative prospects. An image of ineffectual leadership is never good.  He also had an ambitious foreign policy agenda which was much more successful. This included the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human Rights Berlin Airlift Truman Doctrine Marshall Plan North Atlantic Treaty and the Korean War. You have to remember that isolationist sentiment was still very strong in the United States. Truman's presidency was crucial because he kept the United States intimately involved in international relations in the post-World War II period. But a substantial faction of Republicans was opposed to some or all of these policies. In particular the Korean War was carried out without a declaration of war and under the auspices of enforcing the UN Charter under UN auspices and with the authority of a UN Security Council resolution. Imagine what that must have meant to a country which 30 years earlier had rejected the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations! And furthermore the war turned into a stalemate in which tens of thousands of American troops were killed. Dwight Eisenhower came into office largely on the back of this issue and the idea that Truman was overextending the country. His corrective was to reign in the Korean War-era defense budget and put much more emphasis on nuclear deterrence creating the Cold War as we know it. It was a sort of return to normalcy (to quote Warren Harding) that the American people were looking for. Eisenhower normalized the Cold War and had a simultaneously more unilateral and more restrained foreign policy.
bang531,history,2015-03-10 9:41,The responsibility for the Korean War falls solely on Stalin. Mao would not have wanted a war so close to China's doorstep. He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea. The UN forces and MacArthur have been warned that any incursion across the Yalu is an act of war and MacArthur was inching to go into China on the back of his successful push back against the North Korean army after the Inchon landing. He was even thinking of using the atomic bomb against China. Of course Truman fired him basically for insubordination when he ignored orders not to expand the war. After all the forces in Korea were there under the auspices of the UN not the US and the mandate was to stop the North Korean not expand the war into China
Serpenz,history,2015-03-10 14:15,&gt  He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The 7th Fleet was sent there after the start of the Korean War. Truman had stood by while Mao had defeated Chiang in mainland China and was ready to allow the same to happen in Taiwan but the invasion of South Korea was one of a number of events that convinced him Mao was an instrument in Soviet global policy rather than an Asian Tito (a nationalist communist independent of Moscow). Note that the fleet was also meant to prevent Chiang from trying to reconquer the mainland.  &gt  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea.  MacArthur's forces didn't cross the Yalu (or Tumen). I'm not entirely sure they actually reached the rivers. But regardless of whether or not US forces were about to cross into Manchuria in 1950 Mao didn't want them at his border.
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:15,This is a very post-hoc justification for the use of the atomic bombs and one that was not promulgated officially until 1947. You can read more about this here (the excellent blog of our own /u/restricteddata): http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/08/the-decision-to-use-the-bomb-a-consensus-view/  The whole entry is great but the pertinent responses to your points above are probably:   &gt  It’s not really clear that Truman ever made much of a “decision” or regarded the bomb/invasion issue as being mutually exclusive. Truman didn’t know if the bomb would end the war  he hoped but he didn’t know couldn’t know. The US was still planning to invade in November 1945. They were planning to drop as many atomic bombs as necessary. There is no contemporary evidence that suggests Truman was ever told that the causalities would be X if the bomb was dropped and Y if it was not. There is no evidence that prior to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Truman was particularly concerned with Japanese causalities radiation effects or whether the bombs were ethical or not. The entire framing of the issue is ahistorical after-the-fact here. It was war  Truman had atomic bombs  it was taken for granted at that point that they were going to be used.   and   &gt  Personally I don’t wade into these questions much professionally or even here on the blog. They honestly don’t interest me very much. Maybe it’s a sign of how post-post-Cold War I am? I don’t know. To me it has always seemed like splitting very fine hairs trying to make distinctions without much difference. In my mind the atomic bombings were plainly not ethically very different than the previous firebombings of Japan or Germany. To argue about whether they were justified or not seems to me to be the wrong question — a question that misleads us into mistaking what the core issue was.  &gt For me the better question is **under what circumstances do we believe the use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians is justified?**  That gets one into much more interesting ethical territory in my opinion than asking why the bombs were used a question that seems to presume that the motivations are somehow the most important thing to ask about. It also keeps us from having the same old discussion that people have been having for nearly 70 years. Maybe it’s my post-postness talking here but whether people in the past had *better or worse intentions* **before** *setting a hundred thousand people on fire* seems like the least interesting historical question to pose in the face of such actions.

jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:11,&gt  had no intention of ending the war before a land invasion could take place just seems to ignore this basic reality.  That's not what I'm saying. The American leadership was happy that the bombs (in combination with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria -- the degree to which each of these put pressure on the Japanese leadership to surrender is a lively debate) were a factor in forcing the Japanese to surrender.   What I'm saying is that a common justification for the atomic bombings which was only promulgated after the war is that the bombs were used specifically by the American leadership to force Japan to surrender *instead of* a land invasion.   The argument usually runs something like well we killed a lot of civilians but it avoided (x million) American and Japanese casualties.   The issue I take with that is threefold:   1) the atomic bombings understood in the context of the war were a continuation of a deliberate policy of destroying Japanese (and German) cities with the attendant understanding that fire bombings would cost hundreds of thousands of civilian lives. So the idea that the atomic bombings and the casualties that resulted from them were somehow a unique event is wrong.   2) The targets for the bombs were selected and the bombs themselves were dropped without really much if any oversight or reference to Truman or anyone else in his cabinet.   We have this post-facto idea that the top leadership agonized over the decision and reluctantly decided that the cost to civilians was outweighed by the rapidity of ending the war. As I said (quoting /u/restricteddata) in my earlier post Truman didn't make any such decision. He was fairly shocked by the use of the bombs and placed a moratorium on their future use after the Nagasaki bombing which further implies that he didn't fully understand their use or intended effect.   3) At the time the bombs were dropped plans for a land invasion of Japan were in full force -- the exigencies of the military situation and the time it would have taken to plan for an invasion meant that it had to be running at full speed when the bomb was dropped. Which further contravenes the idea that we held off on a land invasion and waited for the bombs to work. 
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:44,An excellent suggestion is Fredrik Logevall's *Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam* which covers the French Indochina War and early American involvement in Vietnam. It touches upon the US perspective quite often and how the US went from being against allowing the French to return under Roosevelt to complete support under Truman and Eisenhower.
