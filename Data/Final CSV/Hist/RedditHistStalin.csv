Hinmatoowyalahtqit,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 20:36,Have you checked out this recent (somewhat) relevant thread?  * [Why is the Holocaust so focused on in education compared to other tragedies of the time such as the Mao Zedong era or Stalin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2z04y5/why_is_the_holocaust_so_focused_on_in_education/)
nickanda,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 20:41,thanks! somewhat answers the question but still looking for specific factors that have led Hitler to be remembered as well....Hitler whilst Stalin got off so much more lightly! 
partytemple,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 22:00,The U.S. cared because they had been employing the policy of containment the idea that global communism must be subdued. The Soviet Union under the ideology of Stalinism wanted a worldwide communist revolution because only then would there be a proletariat state without class struggle and maintained by class equality and socialism. This ideology conflicted with the Americans. The U.S. believed that capitalism but not necessarily pure capitalism was the most functional model of economics. Communism is a direct rejection of capitalism. Communists believed that in order to constructed a pure communist world the proletariat must rise against capitalists destroy capitalism and develop a purely proletariat state. Ideologically this is a threat to the U.S.. American-Soviet ambassador George Kennan warned President Truman about the Soviet's masterplan. Kennan thought the Soviet ideology was a threat to traditional American ideals and a poor representation of the Russian people's beliefs. Moreover he believed that the Soviet government was oppressive regime with a delusional philosophy. Truman took Kennan's advise and established his Truman Doctrine which warned the American people about the Soviet's totalitarian ideology.  National ideology however was not the only reason the U.S. joined in the Vietnam War. It may be the main reason but the U.S. also faced a lot of domestic political pressure in its decision to fight and remain in a war against the Vietcong. 
ErwinRommel_1891,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 17:44,The Battle of Stalingrad ended poorly for many reasons despite such a strong beginning for the Wehrmacht. Some of these are mistakes made by the commanders of the primary German formation the 6th Army and others are due to the Soviet Union’s 62nd Army and its positive strengths as well as those of its leader General Zhukov.  One of these reasons was the string of bad choices made by the German High Command over the year-long siege. First and possibly most importantly as a basis there was a crucial mistake the Germans made on the first day of the battle. The bombing of the city which required that vast quantities of Wehrmacht bombers and Stukas be drawn from all areas of the front seemed a good idea initially: bomb out the civilians and possible partisans and any garrison soldiers. However this would later become one of the main reasons the city could be held by the Red Army. The completely destroyed ruins meant some areas were near impassable even by foot created conditions where long range fighting was difficult and battles often became close range and even hand to hand and any armoured fighting was instantly pitched in favour of the infantry should they possess anti-armour weapons and equipment (the anti-tank rifle which looked much like a large sniper was used to great effect in these conditions). Another mistake then which ties into this point is that the commanders of 6th Army kept their panzers fighting in the city which was not only wasteful but can be said to be one of the contributing factors to the eventual encirclement of the 6th Army as they were unavailable for recall counteroffensive or repositioning to break out of the trap engaged on 19th November 1942.  The 6th Army was also stretched precariously along the Don River. The single army held the entire stretch of river for over 150 miles and had only a handful of divisions in reserve. Whilst this is alone a problem the main issue is that the flanks of the 6th were protected by two Romanian armies in the north and south as well as an Italian in the north. When the time for the Red Army’s offensive came her attacking armies in which the 62nd was not included (1st Guards Army 5th Tank Army 21st Army 65th Army 24th Army 66th Army 64th Army 57th Army 51st Army) hit hard around the flanks where the Romanian troops had not the proper equipment nor full-strength division not the morale  and then there were the Italians who were Italian in all military sense and thus had little equipment or morale. In both allied armies the fighting men were also looked upon with disdain from their commanding officers which Erwin Rommel also witnessed in Africa stating that “it is as though they are two different species” (paraphrasing) – this did not encourage their soldiers to fight well. The Red Army armoured formations smashed through these Axis-allied armies with little issue (though being early-war Red Army they were still inexperienced forces and suffered surprising casualties considering the calibre of the 6th Army’s flanks). The fact that as earlier stated there were no German response armoured divisions and few reinforcing German formations plus a hesitance to act on behalf of the German command all meant that there was a quick if costly assault and encirclement carried out by a large Russian force on an overextended Axis formation which in the end could simply not break out effectively (other reasons out with the boundaries of the question exist as to why the formation capitulated and was completely destroyed in the end).   The shear tenacity and sometimes brilliance of Red Army soldiers cannot be overlooked though. The resolve of their men was impeccable for much of the battle though many still did dessert under incredibly stressful conditions and many were executed for this. Red Army tactics also evolved to fight in a war which mirrored WW1 in brutality but was almost purely urban – hand to hand combat  eight-man fireteams armed with knives SMGs and snipers  the use of bombed out buildings as key fortresses and choke points  traversing sewers  hugging the enemy lines (the front line was never more than 100 yards from the Germans’ so that the German artillery had to be very particular and careful in danger of friendly fire)  jury-rigged weapons and equipment  traps and contraptions MacGuyver would be proud of (AA-guns made of wood and stolen German MGs which were adept at taking down and scaring off Stukas)  and of course pure resolve. The battles were so intense that they were known as Rattenkrieg (rat war) to the Wehrmacht soldiers. The tenacity of the defending 62nd Army at Stalingrad and their ability to hold onto the west bank of the Volga river (by the skin of their teeth for the most part) as well as simply having the bodies to throw at the problem ensured that the Red Army continued to hold onto the key city until the two Red Army operations Little Saturn (cancelled in favour of operation Uranus) and Uranus could be enacted to relieve and recapture the city proper.  Finally the aid of the Allies whilst not often acknowledged gave the Red Army the aid it needed. Actual fighting equipment give through the lend lease was considered inferior and ineffective by the Red Army the most famous being that they thought the M4 Sherman was utter tripe but Allied grain meat and Studebaker Ford Willys et cetera trucks and jeeps made all the difference in the capability to fight longer and achieve greater strategic reach. The trucks especially were useful and over 600000 were delivered over the course of the war. They were used to carry artillery pieces across the field quickly and proved invaluable in the offensive at Stalingrad as they did in so many battles.  Sources:  Anthony Beevor’s ‘Stalingrad’.

ldwr011,history,2015-03-16 21:53,So basically a little after Germany broke their non-aggression pact against the USSR Germany backed the USSR all the way up to the city of Stalingrad. This city was important to the soviets as it was named after their leader and to give it up would be an embarrassment. So the soviets put out their all and utmost power into protecting Stalingrad. When the Germans fought for Stalingrad they lost to the soviets. This was known as the turning point in the war. This is because from then on the USSR and the other allied forces pushed the Germans to the point of Hitler shooting himself and the war in Europe was done. This was also known as V-E Day. (Victory in Europe Day) 
International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 5:52,It was essentially a compromise. When the UN Charter was first being drawn up the Soviets had argued for a limited membership one restricted to the 1942 signatories of the UN Declaration. A broader membership which the US was pushing for would potentially see the Soviet Union permanently outvoted by the Western client states and colonial dominions. As the negotiations dragged on one of the Soviet demands became the admission of *all sixteen* constituent Soviet Republics to the General Assembly.  The eventual compromise saw broad membership be adopted but also strengthened the Security Council and permanent members’ veto. This gave Stalin some assurance that the new body wouldn't become an anti-Soviet vehicle in any meaningful sense. As part of the deal the Soviets also got two of their republics (in addition to the USSR proper) admitted to the General Assembly thus strengthening their bloc in that chamber.

International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 8:06,Post-Stalin is not my area of expertise but in terms of living standards once past the harsh Stalin years the Soviet Union followed a similar upwards curve in living standards as Western Europe. Life did indeed get cheerier from the 1950s onwards – mortality rates fell nutrition improved housing stock was renewed and increased mechanisation eased the peasant’s workload. This was part of the Khrushchev drive to improve living standards. So in absolute terms a late Soviet peasant enjoyed significantly better living standards than his late Tsarist counterpart. Which is as to be expected from an industrialised nation.  (This progress had faltered by the late 1980s when mortality rates began to creep upwards again and living standards stagnated. But that’s outside my comfort zone. Moreover even stagnation would not have devolved )  The question gets a bit more interesting when you look at the *relative* comforts of the Soviet peasantry. After all for all the material progress of the peasantry post-1960 they still lived on collective farms and worked to the state’s tempo. If we take this into account ie consider the peasant’s ‘independence’ then the mid-1920s are worth examining. This was the height of the NEP and probably the high-point of the Russian peasantry: farming their own plots (on commune land) free of noble interference and with little incentive to sell (rather than consume) their produce they would have enjoyed a relatively prosperous life. When compared to the cramped cities at least. The sophisticated (for the time) Soviet nutritional surveys of the period show that during the peak NEP (say 1925-28) the peasants were eating better than they had been in 1913 or 1953.  So it depends on how you cut the question. In terms of material progress (diet life expectancy manufactured goods etc) for an individual peasant then things got progressively better from the late 1950s onwards (to the late 1970s at least). In terms of their position and living standards relative to the urban world then the mid-1920s are where you want to look. What is absolutely clear is that the 1930s are the period in which the peasantry had the worst of both worlds: severely lacking for material comforts (eg food) and suffering intense state repression.  Sources: Stephen Wheatcroft’s done a fair amount of work on the early decades of Soviet rule. See particularly his *First 35 Years of Soviet Living Standards (2009)* and *The Great Leap Upwards (1999)*. Robert Allen (*Farm to Factory*) would disagree with my assessment of the 1930s somewhat. I’ve taken the vaguer post-Stalin picture from a few general works.
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)  it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:26,The parts of Germany gave to Poland was compensation demanded by the Western Allies for taking easter territories of Poland. Today's Kaliningrad Oblast' was to be part of Poland aswell (with the city of Kaliningrad bearing name Królewiec) although Stalin changed his mind in the last moment and decided to add this territory to the RSFSR. Lwów which is considered to be the one of the two main (along with Kraków) cities where the Polish elite was being raised has been given to the Ukrainian SSR as it had claim on it and meant that one of the very important places where the polish patriotism could be continiued ceased to exist.  The case of Baltics while might seem complicated was pretty simple. The countries had fairy low population and even though each of them had very different culture with and unlike Ukraine/Belarus had nothing in common with Russia they couldn't pose any real threat. The USSR also played the better safe than sorry card and made the Baltic States a place where Soviet Army officers were sent for retirement. This resulted in fairly large russian minority being still present in these countries today. Stalin did almost the same thing with Crimea although he took a step further there and instead of only moving russian citizens there he expelled most of the Tatar people from there to Siberia in fear of organized resistance (as the Tatar community much like the Poles are known for their ferocity in fights against opressors).  As for the Chechens i fear that although I know a bit of their cause my knowledge is not sufficent to provide you a quality answer. I can only guess that they underestimated them and it serves them right to this day since they have constant insurgency in that area.
stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
aleksey2,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:22,To clarify Ukraine and Belarus didn't get annexed after WW2 but were enlarged in size by seizing land from liberated countries (in quotes cause while they did get liberated from the Nazis it was held against them as though they had a bill to pay to the USSR for the aforementioned liberation). If I understand correctly you're asking why the USSR didn't annex Poland Romania and Bulgaria and instead allowed them to remain independent states on paper. All the while in practice actually fully controlling what those countries got to do via their respective Socialist governments who were puppets of the Kremlin? If that *is* your question then there could be many explanations as to why none of which are good enough to explain everything on their own. Having said that I think two really good reasons as to why are 1) deniability and 2) creating a buffer zone.  **Deniability** - the best of both worlds if your worlds consist solely of 'wanting to exert control' and 'not wanting to pay anything for it'. USSR was all like Who me? Naah bruh I don't control those countries. They are *totally* independent have their own *elected* governments and do as they please.   When you annex a territory you gotta deliver a benefit for the people you're annexing. Romans solved it by giving the conquered Roman citizenship and creating some peace and prosperity (albeit that changed depending on the era of Roman Republic/Empire). In return Romans got to extract/take what they wanted and needed from the new province. It hasn't really changed much - you gotta give the people you're conquering something in return for their freedom. And that's a costly endeavour  something that a war-torn country might not be willing to consider. Instead if what you really want is to control the population AND you can get that control by getting the governments of those countries to do your bidding for you (and to coöperate fully with your requests) then you've just achieved control without exerting any serious costs. Now you get what you want and you have to provide **none** of the services and benefits you would have had to if you annexed that same territory.  Btw this all assumes that the territory in question isn't full of oil or any other natural resources. Cause in those cases empires will still want to annex it any *any* cost.   **Buffer zone.** It wasn't exactly clear that a new conflict wasn't going to start after Berlin fell. The West never truly trusted the USSR and vice versa even while they shared the common enemy. With the new enemy soon-to-be gone (or now gone if we're talking about post-may-1945) it wasn't assumed that peace will reign in. The USSR was prepared for a new conflict if it would arise and the bigger the buffer zone between the West and Moscow the better. Now if you can control and coordinate with Polish/Romanian/Bulgarian governments and military without having to spend any money on their citizens then you've achieve your objective. Now you can have a new war and hope that it stays contained within the countries on the periphery of USSR. You get two outcomes from this. Either USSR wins or it loses. In both cases you the USSR hope that the conflict takes place and *stays* in those countries. That way if you have to surrender and pull out you haven't actually lost any territory that's your own. If it's a costly stalemate or if you win by way of 'scorched earth/leave no building standing' tactic of military attack then you just make Poland/Romania/Bulgaria weaker in the process. Now whether you win or lose they will be too poor and bombed out to either be a threat or to stand on their own. If they stay allied to Moscow they'll be even weaker to resists Kremlin's influence. If they flip sides and join the West then the logic is that it would be so costly to rebuild them and that the West would never want to spend the money to do so.  Fundamentally the decisions of WW2 USSR and post-WW2 USSR were made by Stalin a certified lunatic and a deranged psychopath who viewed the world as a constant us vs. them struggle and regarded all human lives with outmost of disregards (obligatory link to what happened to Stalin's own [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Dzhugashvili#Second_World_War)).
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 3:23,Stalin wasn't heavily involved in the war but it's widely believed from official accounts that Kim Il-Sung received his 'go-ahead' to start the war directly from Stalin and Mao.
TheEllimist,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 5:41,Perhaps that means the journal(s) of people that had contact with Stalin? 
bang531,history,2015-03-10 9:41,The responsibility for the Korean War falls solely on Stalin. Mao would not have wanted a war so close to China's doorstep. He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea. The UN forces and MacArthur have been warned that any incursion across the Yalu is an act of war and MacArthur was inching to go into China on the back of his successful push back against the North Korean army after the Inchon landing. He was even thinking of using the atomic bomb against China. Of course Truman fired him basically for insubordination when he ignored orders not to expand the war. After all the forces in Korea were there under the auspices of the UN not the US and the mandate was to stop the North Korean not expand the war into China
Herge,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 11:37,So the week in question was from June 22nd to ? And that Stalin was still in contact with the politburo during all this?  It still does not sound like a week-long mental breakdown.
Mrman53,history,2015-03-10 12:40,My perception is that Kim wanted the war and the fact that Stalin allowed it to happen was huge.  Edit: leading up to the Korean conflict Kim Il Sung asked the CCP multiple times to aid the invasion. Finally Stalin said yes and sent weapons to help the DRPK. If the DPRK would have gone without Russian aid there would most defiantly be a different story.  Edit: fixed names
vet_laz,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 13:45,/u/kieslowskifan and /u/international_KB   thank you both for your replies!  @ /u/kieslowskifan  thanks for linking to the research by Harrison I've already started reading and its quite interesting! Add to the fact that its free as well! I had looked online for books on this particular subject but oddly everything I could find (on amazon that is) was in the $100-150 price range. They didn't appear to be text books either? I found that really strange.   I've only just begun to understand the dire situation the Soviets were faced with in 1942. Mainly it has to do with what I've read about the fighting around Moscow and Rzhev in '42. I'm interested to know more about these battles and I'll look into getting books that specifically cover the subject because everything I own and have read so far  overshadows this conflict with what happened in the south during Case Blue and then at Stalingrad. If you have any pointers on reading materials in thus regard I'll gladly take note. Cheers!  @ /u/international_KB  I wanted to say first and foremost that your reply didn't seem offhand or hastily written. I'm not a student or academic so I don't have crazy standards or anything hahaha. No offense to students or academics!  I watched a documentary recently that said government reports from the time stated something like a million freight cars had been shipped east by rail during the initial stages of the invasion. Unofficially it was said that if you had lined up these freight cars from end to end they would have stretched from the original western borders all the way to the Pacific. Whether that claim is true or not I think what was accomplished is nothing short of astonishing. If I'm not mistaken I seem to recall having read that several tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of freight cars were caught in a massive traffic jam further to the east of the Volga in the southern part of the union as they were moved east.  Just let me know if this is covered in the writings by Harrison as I've only just started with them. You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines? To my understanding after the defeats suffered during 1941 and with portions of the war industry having been transported cross country and then needing to be subsequently reestablished the winter and spring portions of 1942 can be seen as perhaps the darkest period for the Red Army. New formations were created to replace the losses sustained the year prior but arming these new units was set back by the situation within the munitions industry as a whole. Something that would have a major effect on the Red Army as they attempted to push the Germans further back from the Moscow area in the first half of '42. Correct?  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  I've taken note of the two books you mentioned and I'll look into purchasing them at a later date. Cheers!    **At that I thank the both of you for helping me further my understanding on the subject!**  *This doesn't have to be answered if its considered trivial or irrelevant but the question is in relation to Soviet agriculture. Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals? When speculating about alternate outcomes of the eastern front I've read the argument that the Soviets would have retreated into Siberia and continued the resistance from there although it doesn't seem like there would be any significant portion of farmland based there beforehand?* 
DatDinkleberg,history,2015-03-10 14:56,The main instigator of the Korean War was Syngman Rhee not Kim Il-Sung nor Stalin he excluded leftists and communists from politics his forces also did the Mungyeong massacre blamed it on communist guerrillas jailed nearly 30000 communists and enrolled nearly 300000 suspected sympathizers in the Bodo League. Kim Il-Sung attacked the South just to free it's people from the oppression of this rightist dictator.
quant271,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:17,Stalin made a graduation speech at the Soviet army officers academy in which he told the to expect war with Germany soon.   I don't think Whaley had a direct statement from Stalin about an ultimatum but he had the German records from Intelligence and Diplomacy and some Soviet material which support the inference.  The Germans were trying to push the ultimatum idea as a deception plan.     I'll have to reread that book.  Since the book came out before the collapse of the Soviet Union it would be very interesting to look at this again in light of the documents available now.
DeadWeaselRoad,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:09,I took a Russian history course in last spring and my professor explained that Stalin did not have a real plan as far as what countries would come under the USSR's control but rather however far the Red Army would get would become part of the Soviet Union.   I can't speak to the Soviet leaders after him without being speculative so I won't.   This article might help you a bit.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/ir2/sovietexpansionineasterneuroperev1.shtml
International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:18,&gt  You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines?  To be clear my area of knowledge tends to be the Soviet economy as a whole rather than the specifics of logistical supply during the war. So the idea that any munitions crisis was the product of supply/transportation difficulties is pure conjecture. It may just be that the volumes produced while impressive simply weren't enough to cope with the intensity of the fighting. What I can say with confidence that Soviet armaments and munition production increased each year during the war and continually outstripped Germany. To quote from Adam Tooze's *Wages of Destruction*:  &gt  If there was a true 'armaments miracle' in 1942 it occurred not in Germany but in the armaments factories in the Urals. Despite having suffered territorial losses and disruption that resulted in a 25 per cent fall in total national product the Soviet Union in 1942 managed to out-produce Germany in virtually every category of weapons. The margin for small arms and artillery was 3:1. For tanks it was a staggering 4:1 a differential compounded by the superior quality of the T34 tank. Even in combat aircraft the margin was 2:1. It was this industrial superiority contrary to every expectation that allowed the Red Army first to absorb the Wehrmacht's second great onslaught and then in November 1942 to launch a whole series of devastating counterattacks.  But this is 1942. What is more accurate is to note is that in the 'darkest days' of the second half of 1941 there was an immense demand for munitions at precisely the time that production and transport were undergoing severe strain/dislocation. This was the period in which shortages of arms would have been greatest - as entire armies were lost and the economic mobilisation was still underway. From 1942 onwards (perhaps excluding Q1) however with the war economy established the problem became the opposite - how to avoid crashing the economy through excessive mobilisation.  &gt  Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals?  Not quite. The USSR was split into a six agricultural producer/consumer regions three of each. Much of the Southern Producer Region (ie the Ukraine) was lost to the Germans along with a chunk of the Central Producer Region (which included the Volga area). But the Eastern Producer Region (Siberia and most of Central Asia) was unoccupied and continued to produce. However these areas were not as naturally productive as those lands in European Russia and comprised maybe 25% of overall grain production (based on some very rough maths by me drawing on Davies' *Years of Hunger*).  That said the agricultural situation was severe. Granted the Germans had 'relieved' Moscow of about a third of its population during their advance but they'd also (deliberately) seized the prime grain producing areas. In 1942 agricultural output was a mere 40% of the pre-war level. This continued to be a severe strain on the Soviet population and economy until a recovery of sorts in 1944-45.  &gt  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  Which is a topic that I won't go into much. What I will say is that while industrialisation was an objective shared by all Bolsheviks the Stalinist form that it ultimately took during the 1930s was incredibly wasteful. I'd also question why the Soviets needed to effectively rebuild their army from scratch in 1941 - Stalin's purging and flawed pre-war deployments much surely take much of the blame for the catastrophe of Barbarossa.
Cruentum,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:11,I never said it was. I think it was from June 22nd to July 3rd or 4th (when Stalin made his own speech to the Soviet Union which he never did before then).           Again the mental breakdown legend comes from Chakovsky (who wasn't there) and Khrushchev (who was there). Molotov (who was there) said he didn't do it as a mental breakdown but to sort things out and had left with Malenkov while keeping in contact. So yeah it does sound like he wasn't losing it as much as Khrushchev proclaimed. 
THIS_IS_SO_HILARIOUS,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 4:48,I would be very careful to use Khrushchev for source on Stalin it been known that Khrushchev is known for distorting and lying on Stalin's activity. He was a victim of the Ukraine famine himself and did sought to destroy any reputation on Stalin even with lying.
This_Is_The_End,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:20,I didn't knew that. I believed the relationship was solely influenced by the support for mercenaries and Poland in the Polish-Sovjet war.  At least all this together gives a nice hint why Stalin made his movements. 
ShootingPains,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 7:58,I recall that Beevor talks about an all woman anti-tank regiment in his Stalingrad book. 
Georgy_K_Zhukov,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:00,Yeah as the Germans approached Stalingrad Soviet forces in the region were sparse so they threw just about anything with a pulse at them to delay it. '*Narodnoe Opolcheniye*' or citizen levies were utilized and saw workers from the Barrikady Ordnance Factory the Red October Steel Works and the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory thrown at the Germans with little real training and very underarmed.
joefurry,history,2015-03-11 11:41,In terms of 'human history' I would say Stalingrad.   It had the most combatants and was the bloodiest battle of all time in absolute terms.  If the German's had won then it would have likely been all over for Russia. Germany would be able to take the oil in the Caucasus region and refocus efforts on taking Moscow.   As it was the Germans lost 1 million men and had no further strategic victories in the East.   Maybe the Western Allies would have beaten Germany but if Russia had fallen the war would probably seen a much heavier genocide and the Western Allies losses would have been much much higher. It's possible that they wouldn't have been able to win and the USA would have sued for peace rather than unconditional surrender.   This scenario is all laid out in the horrifying novel Fatherland by Robert Harris. 
BFGDoomer,history,2015-03-11 12:26,Stalingrad is a great choice. Very horrible battle too.
