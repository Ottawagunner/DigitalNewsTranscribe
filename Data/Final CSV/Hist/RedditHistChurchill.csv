MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 14:05,i only say war progresses human civ in a way that expediates the process. humans would have found each other without armies on the move we would have traded other things along the way (not just war materials taxes etc) and exchanged culture as well. i would argue though that without war we probably wouldnt have cell phones or tvs or radio or modern infastructure or modern farming techniques and logistics in governing hundreds of millions per state.  also i dont know who considers Mussolini a great man he was kind of weak willed IMO and couldnt even hold a stick to Hitler(not even the greatest man of his Generation[Churchill]) so i wont draw those comparisons:)
Hawkeye117,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:08,Sorry the 'extremely incompetent' remark ended up being very general. But you sort of addressed it. I was referring specifically to the incompetent generals and commanders of WWI who ordered waves-upon-waves of soldiers in what were obviously suicidal attacks. Men like Hamilton and Churchill's Dardanelles farce.   Also I'd just like to add a few questions if I may.   &gt  Hindenburg Mackensen Heeringen Kluck Gallwitz Hutier Mudra Below were all very accomplished commanders and NONE were high ranking aristocrats.   Being in the positions that they were in how were they viewed by the aristocracy who served under/above/with them? Was there discrepancy between aristocratic commanders and non-aristocratic ones? And did their merit and achievement earn them a deal of respect that meant they were also seen as members of the elite?    Also did soldiers of certain units display more of a sense of loyalty to their commanders if they were a part of the aristocracy specifically if they were a royal of the unit's respective region?    And lastly was the Kaiser's role in military affairs to simply be the man who signs off as the highest ranking officer and says Yes go ahead with that offensive etc. Or did he take an active role in the planning and carrying-out of operations? If so was he challenged? Or did his close staff simply refrain from objecting to his plans in fear of reprisal much like that of Hitler.
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 14:29,&gt  I was referring specifically to the incompetent generals and commanders of WWI who ordered waves-upon-waves of soldiers in what were obviously suicidal attacks. Men like Hamilton and Churchill's Dardanelles farce.  Im not really going to address the misapprehension that attacks during World War I were obviously suicidal  I will leave that to posters such as /u/nmw and /u/elos_ in threads such as these:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t77wz/we_have_all_heard_of_the_mass_infantary_charges/c4k7e10  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16obi4/in_world_war_i_why_would_a_general_ever_order_his/c7xttjg/  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2vgopo/why_did_trench_warfare_stop_after_ww1/  But speaking specifically to the Dardanelles the lesson of that campaign is less that Churchill was an incompetent as it is a cautionary tale about mission creep. The goal of the initial Dardanelles expedition was to use British naval power -- specifically older battleships that could not stand in the line of battle -- to blast a way through the Straits and bring their guns to bear on Constantinople hopefully toppling the Ottoman regime or at least forcing them to terms. (This is not as farfetched as it sounds because one ship *SMS Goeben* had essentially tipped the country into the war.)   The Straits were known to be mined and also to be defended by heavy guns. In the brutal logic of the war Churchill figured that even losing several older battleships with their crews was less bloody in the long term than infantry attacks on the Western front.   The problem with the naval expedition was that the Ottomans had a surprisingly stout interlocking defense both of lines of mines and also of large guns. There's also a pretty significant current in the Strait. So an initial effort by battleships to force their way through was marked by an early defeat (and a bit of timidity on the British part when they discovered the mines). The minesweepers (converted fishing trawlers) the British then bought to the Straits were deeper in draft than the anchored mines which tended to depress morale among the crews of the sweepers. Nevertheless they successfully swept at least two of the lines of mines before fire from shore batteries knocked out several of the minesweepers. At that point they rethought their approach and brought in the *HMS Queen Elizabeth* to try to knock out the shore batteries by firing over the peninsula (from the Aegean side). This was actually fairly successful and the Turkish batteries were running low on shot and becoming desperate before the battle of March 18 in which an undetected minefield sank three of the Franco-British battleships and forced a withdrawal. (It's arguable that had the fleets pressed on the Ottomans might have withdrawn from the peninsula  we will never know. Ottoman morale was wavering and the batteries were nearly silenced  the fleet's withdrawal allowed them to restock and replenish.)    In any case the failure of the ships themselves to be able to knock out the guns led to a call for a landing at the Dardanelles using troops to secure the batteries. At that point the Strait could be swept of mines at the fleet's leisure. Unfortunately that led to Anzac Cove and the bloody fight to follow where far more lives were lost than those on three obsolete battleships.    **tl dr:** The Dardanelles campaign was poorly planned and insufficiently supported but it was not in its conception or aims necessarily wrongheaded. It was like many aspects of WWI in that the technology and tactics of the time had simply fallen behind defensive technology and in which a great loss of life would have to be accepted for even the most basic of gains. 
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)  it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.
Theoroshia,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:20,changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us - are you sure you're being non-biased?
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:34,I guess you could say that but I belive that was the case. France and Great Britain were to attack Germany right away should they invade Poland. Before the attack took place Marshall Piłsudski insisted that Poland and France should make preventive invasion of Germany due to them ignoring Treaty of Versailles conditions which were dismissed by France. After Germany invaded Poland all that Western Allies did was declare war and take no military action. Everyone in Poland was sure that they only need to hold the invasion for a short time to stall German offensive allowing France and Britain to take necessary action. After Poland was defeated the government on the exile created Polish forces which fought extraordinary in various battles during the war. Battle of Britain was won thanks to Polish and Czechoslovakian pilots (Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. was the words Churchill said after victory). They also fought in Arnhem (6. SBS led by General Sosabowski) in Narvik (1. Polish Independent Highland Brigade) Tobruk (3. Polish Carpathian Infantry Division) and Falaise (1. Armoured Division led by General Maczek). The fought alongside the very people who betrayed their beloved country because they belived that they won't betray them again. They fought to the very end without knowing that the decision to hand Poland to the eastern bloc under russian rule was already made during Yalta Conference. After this all don't you think that betrayal is the correct used word here?
stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
BPalmer4,history,2015-03-09 18:52,Winston Churchill. He had great intelligence was an unmatched orator and able to move people. 
Bigglesworth_,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 7:01,That's not quite right  Dowding's strategy was to preserve Fighter Command as a force in being to deny the Luftwaffe air superiority rather than to shoot down as many bombers as possible the preferred strategy of e.g. Sholto Douglas but Dowding broadly left tactical decisions to his group commanders. 11 Group's Keith Park prioritised early interception of German raids by whatever fighters could reach them soonest more in line with Dowding's strategy whereas 12 Group's Trafford Leigh-Mallory favoured the Big Wing taking the time to assemble multiple squadrons for a massed attack with some support from Douglas and others at the Air Ministry not least thanks to lobbying from the likes of Douglas Bader backed up by large numbers of claimed kills that in post-war analysis turned out to be wildly optimistic.  There was considerable personal acrimony between Park and Leigh-Mallory and from Leigh-Mallory towards Dowding for giving Park command of 11 Group. There was a famous staff conference on October 17th 1940 concerning Day Fighter Tactics that turned out to be a Big Wing ambush chaired by Douglas with heated discussions primarily between Park and Leigh-Mallory and little input from Dowding concluding that Leigh-Mallory's tactics were correct. Dowding wasn't popular and had been due to be replaced as Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command before the war  he wasn't court-martialed as a result of the October conference but he was rather unceremoniously shuffled out of Fighter Command in November 1940 lack of success in intercepting night raids being the final nail in his coffin.  There was a suggestion that Dowding's silence at the conference was deliberate and that he could have referred to Ultra intelligence to prove that Park's tactics (and by extension Dowding's strategy) were correct but he chose to preserve the Ultra secret. This (and the more general impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain) is disputed by e.g. John Terraine in *The Right of the Line* and Harry Hinsley in *British Intelligence in the Second World War*. According to Sebastian Cox in *A Comparative Analysis of RAF and Luftwaffe Intelligence in the Battle of Britain 1940* Dowding may not even have been aware of the true nature of Ultra at the time as a minute from Churchill on October 16th asked that Cs-in-C of Fighter and Bomber Command be let in on the secret though other accounts suggest he may have known from August.
stillbevens,history,2015-03-10 16:00,Churchill was one of the architects of this operation btw
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 16:46,On August 14 1941 Franklin Roosevelt together with Winston Churchill released a joint declaration which was to go under the name of the *Atlantic Charter*. For this question the sixth clause is the most important one: After the final destruction of Nazi tyranny they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.”   This charter alongside its sixth clause had a tremendous effect in the world and while Winston Churchill was quick to reassure his government that the charter did not apply to the British Empire Roosevelt had meant for it to apply universally. FDR had entered the 1940s with a strong anti-colonialist conviction. This of course extended to the belief that France should give up French Indochina (modern day Vietnam Cambodia and Laos). FDR felt very strongly about the possibility that Indochina had been used by the Japanese as a springboard for the initial conquests in 1942 (it wasn't) and adding onto his generally bleak opinion about the French after its defeat in 1940 made him very determined to speak out against French colonialism in Indochina.  This does not mean that Roosevelt saw Indochina was being prepared for independence. Roosevelt had at occasions displayed in the words of Fredrik Logevall a patronizing and cryptoracist view of the Vietnamese and considered them unfit to rule themselves. Instead he suggested a more paternalistic suggestion in which a *trusteeship* would be established along the lines of the mandate system of the League of Nations. These former colonies would be helped to independence through a series of stages culminating in total independence.  Roosevelt was very reluctant in allow Free French regular forces to return to Indochina and while he began to look the other way as Free French forces were deployed with the help from the British towards the end of his own life (and the war) Roosevelt still remained convinced that allowing France to return to Indochina was a bad idea - even though it began to falter due to the realities of the war itself. To Roosevelt the final (and inevitable) goal was universal decolonization.
MisterBigStuf,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:52,Churchill you can't be serious?
JesuIsEveryNameTaken,history,2015-03-10 20:14,How was Churchill able to rebound politically years later after such a catastrophe? 
adave4allreasons,history,2015-03-10 22:17,One of the most ill-conceived plans ever.  Just like Churchill's Italian campaign.  Apparently he never understood that mountains make a difference in battle.  
macros-the-black,history,2015-03-10 23:37,Churchill had a few howlers. But his successes were more numerous. And he was old money.   It's interesting to compare this to modern politics where one mistake can cost a politician their career because of the availability of information through myriad media channels.   Churchill got away some serious missteps in judgement and went on to become what many would consider a 'great leader'. Wonder how many 'great leaders' we've missed out on because of the unforgiving nature of modern politics. 
cosmitz,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 8:06,is my memory failing or did the british use the Churchill hvac there? 
eadingas,history,2015-03-11 8:29,His entire political career is a series of controversies gaffes and misjudgements. He languished on the back benches for almost a decade. If it wasn't for the WWII he'd have likely been remembered as at best an average politician  at worst - a monster (he sanctioned the use of gas on the Kurds machine guns on striking workers and expressed a desire to brutally crush Indian independence movement among other things). But his tenacity verging on cruelty proved to be just the thing needed in a world war.    Also in the general carnage and mess that was WWI British people simply didn't pay as much attention to individual actions - and Gallipolli was relatively minor loss for the British forces. Maybe if Churchill was responsible for something like the Somme he'd never bounce back again.
sk_2013,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:54,I'm pretty sure he means the AVRE unless Churchill had a secret weapon centering around central air.
twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:31,Margaret Thatcher for US President Winston Churchill for UK PM Ghengis Khan for Russian President All at the same time in present day.  I love my Brits and my Comrades in the motherland but a nice fat world war between those two and a somewhat rational and sane US president would sure make someone else the asshole for the next 50 years. And thats kinda what I want for the US. For us to stop being the asshole. 
twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:35,The man was a drunk and definitely racist. He was a unyielding demonstration of the power of will. Winston Churchill is everything that was needed and his entire fate embodied. He **HAD** to be a stubborn iron willed bulldog. Its who he was made to be.    Not every person the world over will celebrate who he was but their lives have been impacted by his existence.
