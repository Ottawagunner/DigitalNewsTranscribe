VoightKampffTest,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 14:48,Perhaps the alleged Business Plot. Retired Marine Major General  and two time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley Butler (author of [War is a Racket!](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html)) and journalist Paul French testified at the House Special Committee on Un-American Activities that a group of powerful businessmen and industrialists had contacted them about a plan to launch a coup against President Franklin Roosevelt.   Butler was a widely admired war hero and they thought he was the man they needed to rally and organize veterans into a movement akin to the Weimar-era Germany Freikorps. Once they had the muscle the plan was to either depose Roosevelt or turn him into their puppet enacting fascistic reforms modeled after those of Mussolini's Italy.   &gt French testified that MacGuire stated **“We need a fascist government in this country to save the Nation from the Communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America. The only men who have patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader. He could organize one million men over night.**  &gt Continuing French stated that during the conversation MacGuire told him about his trip to Europe and of the studies that he had made of the Fascist Nazi and French movements and the parts that the veterans had played in them. &gt ... &gt French further testified that MacGuire considered the movement entirely and tremendously patriotic and that any number of people with big names would be willing to help finance it. French stated that during the course of the conversation MacGuire continually discussed the need of a man on a white horse and quoted MacGuire as having said **We might go along with Roosevelt and then do with him what Mussolini did with the King of Italy.**  &gt MacGuire according to French expressed the belief that half of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars would follow General Butler if he would announce the plan that MacGuire had in mind.  *Testimony of Paul Comly French - Page 21.*  &gt I said The idea of this great group of soldiers then is to sort of frighten him is it?  &gt No no no  not to frighten him. This is to sustain him when others assault him.  &gt He said**You know the President is weak. He will come right along with us.** He was born in this class. He was raised in this class and he will come back. He will run true to form. In the end he will come around. But we have got to be prepared to sustain him when he does.  *Testimony of Maj. Gen. S. D. Butler (Retired) - Page 4*  Again we have very few sources on the existence of the alleged plot beyond the HUAC hearings let alone how far along the conspirators were in serious preparations but if Butler &amp  French's testimony was truthful the Business Plot would doubtless be one of the top candidates.   **Sources**  Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Other Certain Propaganda Activites (PDF Warning)  * [Part 1](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC1.pdf) * [Part 2](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC2.pdf) * [Part 3](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC3.pdf)  [Transcript of the above documents](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/McCormack%E2%80%93Dickstein_Committee#Public_Statement_on_Preliminary_findings_of_HUAC.2C_November_24.2C_1934) 
readher,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 12:04,I can tell you about the situation with Poland although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed)  it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.
Theoroshia,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:20,changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us - are you sure you're being non-biased?
stanthemanfan,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 17:21,I'm no great historian but during the Yalta Conference the other 2 conferences consisting of the US and British and Russian leaders (Churchill Roosevelt Stalin and Truman and Clement Attlee during Potsdam) that promised Poland's independence along the [curzon line] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line) and free elections were promised to the eastern nations [(though once the USSR realized they weren't going to win elections they stopped giving them)] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/how-communism-took-over-eastern-europe-after-world-war-ii/263938/). So they were just 'following' the promises of the multitude of conferences between the Big 3
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 16:46,On August 14 1941 Franklin Roosevelt together with Winston Churchill released a joint declaration which was to go under the name of the *Atlantic Charter*. For this question the sixth clause is the most important one: After the final destruction of Nazi tyranny they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.”   This charter alongside its sixth clause had a tremendous effect in the world and while Winston Churchill was quick to reassure his government that the charter did not apply to the British Empire Roosevelt had meant for it to apply universally. FDR had entered the 1940s with a strong anti-colonialist conviction. This of course extended to the belief that France should give up French Indochina (modern day Vietnam Cambodia and Laos). FDR felt very strongly about the possibility that Indochina had been used by the Japanese as a springboard for the initial conquests in 1942 (it wasn't) and adding onto his generally bleak opinion about the French after its defeat in 1940 made him very determined to speak out against French colonialism in Indochina.  This does not mean that Roosevelt saw Indochina was being prepared for independence. Roosevelt had at occasions displayed in the words of Fredrik Logevall a patronizing and cryptoracist view of the Vietnamese and considered them unfit to rule themselves. Instead he suggested a more paternalistic suggestion in which a *trusteeship* would be established along the lines of the mandate system of the League of Nations. These former colonies would be helped to independence through a series of stages culminating in total independence.  Roosevelt was very reluctant in allow Free French regular forces to return to Indochina and while he began to look the other way as Free French forces were deployed with the help from the British towards the end of his own life (and the war) Roosevelt still remained convinced that allowing France to return to Indochina was a bad idea - even though it began to falter due to the realities of the war itself. To Roosevelt the final (and inevitable) goal was universal decolonization.
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:44,An excellent suggestion is Fredrik Logevall's *Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam* which covers the French Indochina War and early American involvement in Vietnam. It touches upon the US perspective quite often and how the US went from being against allowing the French to return under Roosevelt to complete support under Truman and Eisenhower.
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:29,Perhaps I should have been more concrete: What i meant to say is that he saw Indochina as the springboard for *every* major loss and campaign during the initial Japanese conquest. This also includes the Philippines which clearly had a very urgent relevance for Roosevelt. 
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 12:42,Don't be so certain that things would have gone that different. Roosevelt's thinking was in the face of reality just wishful thinking and while he kept pushing for it there was nothing stopping the French from returning to claim their colony once more in 1945.  FDR saw colonialism in pre-WWI as one of the reasons for that very war and he was also horrified by the treatment of the colonized population under the colonizers. This was also one of the reasons to why he was against the French from returning seeing their treatment of the Vietnamese as something negative.
