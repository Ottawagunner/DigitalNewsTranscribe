MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 13:32,anyone who conquers anything has the right to think highly of themselves.... like you know because he(they) went there(anywhere) and risked his(their) lives and came out the other side. i dont discount the gallic populations suffering but lets be honest...he is a great man and he deserves to be remembered. without folks like Caesar Temüjin Alexander Charles the Great Hitler etc what a weird world we would (more than likely) still live in. War progresses human civilization admittedly at the expense of a certain populace its just a shame we could never ask them (victims) if it was worth it....
MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 14:05,i only say war progresses human civ in a way that expediates the process. humans would have found each other without armies on the move we would have traded other things along the way (not just war materials taxes etc) and exchanged culture as well. i would argue though that without war we probably wouldnt have cell phones or tvs or radio or modern infastructure or modern farming techniques and logistics in governing hundreds of millions per state.  also i dont know who considers Mussolini a great man he was kind of weak willed IMO and couldnt even hold a stick to Hitler(not even the greatest man of his Generation[Churchill]) so i wont draw those comparisons:)
nickanda,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 20:41,thanks! somewhat answers the question but still looking for specific factors that have led Hitler to be remembered as well....Hitler whilst Stalin got off so much more lightly! 
bowlabrown,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 23:04,Thomas Mann also lost his chair for his opposition to the nazis. Bruder Hitler is a short piece well worth the read.
RegnierundRilke,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 4:39,Just an addendum to the above recommendations - Dwyer's series in fact includes a *third* volume covering his exile and last years though I don't think it has been published yet.  It's tremendously difficult to recommend the 'best' biography as Kieslowskifan says: apart from maybe Hitler I'd go as far as to say that probably more biographies have been published on him than any other historical figure (excepting perhaps some individuals of antiquity who may have been granted cursory portraits in various Medieval and Renaissance writings and continue to be worked on today) at least as far as I can think of. There are literally thousands and thousands of books on Napoleon and I certainly don't claim to have read all in the slightest. Indeed in the last few years innumerable biographies have been published in English alone - not to mention others in French German etc. - to the extent that it's quite literally impossible to always keep up. But then it also depends on what *kind* of biography you're looking for: those which stress the military details or focus on his intimate life or with a chronological emphasis on his earlier reigning or later days or even sheer polemic (those extreme contributions to the long-running heroic general/brutal expansionist debate).   Not to throw you off of course  it simple helps to know what you'd be interested in reading even in terms of length and detail. To begin with perhaps refer to an overarching review of various recent biographies  e.g. Charles Esdaile's comparative assessment of five relatively fresh ones: http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1707.
2wicky,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 7:29,The situation in Belgium was as with most things Belgian quite complicated and very controversial. I'll try to give a quick summery.  When the Germans invaded the Belgian government ordered King Leopold III to flee and go in exile with them. Leopold III however wasn't on good terms with the current government of the time. He saw such a move as cowardly and decided to stay with his troops and continue fighting agains the Germans.  When the situation of the Belgian forces became unattainable at the battle of Dunkirk Leopold III surrendered to the Germans. He being a constitutional king doing so without having consulted the government in exile first was scene as an act of treason. Despite being warned of the surrender in advanced the British weren't too happy about it either as this lead to one of their flanks being exposed.  In the mean time Leopold III was placed under house arrest in his palace in Laeken by the Nazis. He refused to cooperate with them forcing the Germans to instil a military government instead. After much insistence Leopold III finally managed to get Hitler to meet with him. He had hoped to convince Hitler to make a statement about the future return of independents of Belgium. When Hitler refused to do so it at least became publicly clear that the king wasn't collaborating with the Nazis. But while he was still defending his own countrymen he made no effort to cooperate with the government in exile.   In the later stages of the war he was deported to Germany and then to Austria. After the war it was advised he not return to Belgium as his role during the war remained controversial. In Belgium the south of the country saw him as a traitor the north saw him as a hero.   A referendum was held and a slight majority voted for his return. But when he did return riots broke out and it was clear he was no longer representing the unifying symbol of what it is to be the king of the Belgians. To prevent further unrest let alone civil war he abdicated from the throne and his son became the new king of the Belgians.

estherke,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 10:32,I wouldn't quite have put it that way myself. Views differed more according to political than to regional allegiances it just so happened that these tended to overlap. The left-wing parties who had a larger support base in Wallonia were opposed to the King's return  the conservative (catholic) parties were in favour and these had more support in Flanders. Why Wallonia was and is more left-wing has many reasons that we can't go into here.   The conservative rhetoric was that the king was a tragic figure who remained loyal to his people by not leaving the country in a time of need and by doing the best he could in difficult circumstances.  The left-wing rhetoric saw the king as a crypto nazi who hobnobbed with Hitler. He was also much resented for hastily marrying his girlfriend (his first wife had died) when she turned out to be pregnant. This was felt to be a reflection of a dissipated and/or frivolous lifestyle in essence he was living it up with loose women while the POWs languished abroad and the people suffered under the iron heel of the occupier.
Poefi,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:08,after the lost WWI Hungary's partly isolative foreign policy was used to gain political ground and search for new allies. while quitting the League of Nations Hungary joined the Anticomitern-Pact in february 1939 joined the Axis in november 1940 and declared war on the USSR in juni 1941. Hungary was a German ally and was on a good way to become a German vassal but due to its neutral foreign policy and hesitation in war participation was not considered a trustworthy ally. Germany occupied Hungary and tried to push to the east one last time during WWII.  it was more important to Germany that Hungary ally up with them and not with one of their enemies than Hungary's actual military contribution to the war. Hungarians were tolerated but due to their non indo-european language could not be scientically considered as aryans. what would happen to them after Hitler's final vicotry? we will never know for sure.  still in 1935 to suck in its finno-ugric speaking allies (Finland Estonia Hungary) Germany changed the term aryan in official state documents and used person with german or similar blood instead.  Hitler once said its unforgiven that the Budapest with its Attila-breed Huns is the most beautiful city along the Danube and not one Niebelung city  i also read somewhere that Göring wanted to claim the hungarian throne so desperately that he let his family-tree magyarised what went so succesfull that he is still considered a 7th degree Árpád descendant. he also dated his own coronation: just after the final victory.  optionally you can read this article i found in this topic: [G. Baross - Hungary and Hitler](http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/baross/baross00.htm)
Hawkeye117,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:08,Sorry the 'extremely incompetent' remark ended up being very general. But you sort of addressed it. I was referring specifically to the incompetent generals and commanders of WWI who ordered waves-upon-waves of soldiers in what were obviously suicidal attacks. Men like Hamilton and Churchill's Dardanelles farce.   Also I'd just like to add a few questions if I may.   &gt  Hindenburg Mackensen Heeringen Kluck Gallwitz Hutier Mudra Below were all very accomplished commanders and NONE were high ranking aristocrats.   Being in the positions that they were in how were they viewed by the aristocracy who served under/above/with them? Was there discrepancy between aristocratic commanders and non-aristocratic ones? And did their merit and achievement earn them a deal of respect that meant they were also seen as members of the elite?    Also did soldiers of certain units display more of a sense of loyalty to their commanders if they were a part of the aristocracy specifically if they were a royal of the unit's respective region?    And lastly was the Kaiser's role in military affairs to simply be the man who signs off as the highest ranking officer and says Yes go ahead with that offensive etc. Or did he take an active role in the planning and carrying-out of operations? If so was he challenged? Or did his close staff simply refrain from objecting to his plans in fear of reprisal much like that of Hitler.
Venmar,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 12:34,Nazi viewpoints varied vastly across the races of Europe. Sometimes like Vonadler mentioned they'd change specifically due to the actions of the residing country of the race. Nonetheless racial views were inconsistent.  The Nazi overview of the Latins chiefly Frenchmen Spaniards and Italians varied. Since the latter two were Fascist states Nazi view on them was obviously favorable. However helped by typical French-German animosity and rivalry the Nazi's saw the French probably lukewarm at best they didn't consider the French subhuman or inferior but hardly gave them the respect they deserved.   The Spaniards were described by Hitler as the only Tough Latins and seemed to favour them above all of the rest of the Latin races. Spanish volunteer divisions participated on the Eastern Front primarily the *Blue Division* where Hitler described the Spanish as almost equal to that of German divisions. Undoubtedly Nazi view of the Spanish was favorable both due to Hitlers seeming approval of them and their current government being Fascist.  Can't speak much for the Italians however I imagine that the Nazis didn't view the Italians subhumans just incompetent due to their failure to do well anything really in war on the side of the Axis.  You mentioned the Romanians as Slavs which is incorrect Romanians are latins just like the French Spanish etc. Romania had a decently large population of Gypsies which the Nazis prosecuted and hated. Romanians in general however weren't directly prosecuted or hated. Nonetheless Nazi regard for the Romanians was low as the war went on and continually stripped weapons tanks and supplies from Romanian units to arm German divisions then got mad when the Romanians performed poorly. This was a pattern repeated with other Axis allies too.  The occupied people of the Lowland countries the Dutch and the Belgians were viewed fairly well. They weren't considered subhuman and considered to be somewhat Aryan especially the Dutch whose language was similar to German and their traits similar as well. The Dutch were and are a tall people (an important aspect of Aryan attributes) with a distinctively Germanic language and culture and were therefore looked at fairly. Both were considered viable candidates to be Aryans. The Netherlands was however deeply affected by the latter stages of the war as the Germans continually took supplies and food from the country to feed their own people and troops and the hunting of Jews was very extensive in both Belgium and the Netherlands.  The Scandinavians Swedes and Norwegians were seen as the ideal Aryans and were therefore regarded very highly. Political situations however such as the uncertain response of Sweden to Operation Barbarossa hurt their reputation as none of the Scandinavian races were really fond of the Nazi's. The Danes were among the same level as these.  Now the Slavic races had it much harder. Poles Czechs and Slovaks are all Slavic and the Germans were very harsh with their treatment of them. In the occupied Czech Republic the Germans planned to eventually either remove the Czechs and replace them with Germans or ruthlessly Germanize them. In Poland Poles were murdered and killed alongside their Jewish brethren just for being Slavic. The Germans also planned to do the same in Poland as in the Czech Republic and replace much of Poland with Germans especially lands previously held by Prussia or the German Empire. (In fact in general the Nazis wanted to deport most or at least as many as possible Slavic peoples to Siberia as the Germans believed they'd win over the USSR. The plan was to ruthlessly Germanize what Slavs could be saved and deport the rest to Siberia and replace them with Germans. This was the driving factor behind the German prosecution and attack on the Slavic people as the Germans needed to displace them due to their position in the East which the Nazi's considered to be the living space of the German people.) The Slovaks the only of the three that theoretically fought alongside the Germans were viewed a bit better but were nonetheless battered by Nazi opinion. Since the Poles Czechs and Slovaks made up a fair portion of the Eastern European population German oppression of all three was significant. However this didn't stop the Germans from eventually recruiting Czechs Slovaks and even Poles into their Army and even the Waffen SS. The most successful Panzer ace in the war [Kurt Knispel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Knispel) who scored at least 168 confirmed tank kills with potentially as many as 195 was a Sudeten German from the Czech Republic. Yet since he was from the Czech Republic (and due to his laid back personality and longer har) he was never promoted beyond NCO status. The Russians had it the hardest since they were both communist and slavic which made German persecution of them extremelly violent. Much of the death toll for the Holocaust can be attributed to the killing of Russians on the Eastern Front.  I can't speak much for any of the other races. Nazi opinion realy did depend on the position that the country of the race held. While Bulgarians were Slavic with direct/indirect roots to the Russians the Nazi's didn't directly prosecute or attack them because they didn't want to war with Bulgaria one of their few Allies. While the Balkan races were mostly Slavic Nazi persecution of them was not as severe as that of the Poles and Russians because they partly fell under Italian influence and because they weren't directly in the way or of high importance the Germans wanted to settle lands farther North-West from the Balkans. I have no idea what the Nazi's thought of the Hungarians Portugeese or Swiss. 
bemonk,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 16:12,Hitler didn't have to. They basically encouraged themselves.  But your question is oversimplifying. It wasn't just Hitler Youth vs. Scouts  I'm going to get some details wrong but here's how society was split up.  If you were a kid in school and your father was a communist you: Were Red played on the Communist soccer team were a Pioneer and your dad was in the KPD (communist party)  If your father was in the SPD (social democrats) you: Were Light Red (Rose red or pink derogatorily) played on the Soc-Dem soccer team were a Pfadfinder and your dad was in the SPD.  If your dad was a nazi you were: Brown or brown shirt played on the nazi soccer team were with the  Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) and your dad was in the NSDAP.  Everyone was brutal to everyone else. The kids did not mix. Not even KDP and SPD unless playing soccer.  The political divides went from the parents to the children to the schools to every corner of society. Pfadfinder and Pioneer envied the Hitlerjugend because he got a kick-ass dagger and a snazzier uniform... in the 30's there just ended up being less Pfadfinder and Pioneer scouts and more hitler youth scouts.  ...again forgive me on the details. The point is it wasn't just scouts. And yes that totally happened. Hitleryouth's big tactic was being a hard bully.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 18:26,It should be added that after 1933 all rival youth organisations were gradually abolished in favor of the HJ and the BDM (Bund Deutscher Mädel the version for girls). This happened first to the left-leaning organisations then to the politically neutral ones and at last to the christian organisations.  24 members of the HJ died before 1933 in politically inspired violence. How many people died on the other side I don't know. The movie Hitlerjunge Quex portrays the death of one Hitlerjunge as a heroic sacrifice.  One thing that should be mentioned is that the HJ and the BDM was one of the more popular organisations in Nazi Germany. It did offer children of all social backgrounds the opportunity for sports hiking and advancement like commanding the local group. That this was done with the goal of indoctrination and to prepare the next generation for war is the mirror image.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 18:44,Hitler certainly had an effect on the type of art that was popular during his reign. The most striking example is the exhibition on Entartete Kunst which took place in Munich in 1937 and the exhibition on german art which took place at the same time. The opening speech sums up his idea of art pretty well. The influence also extended to music (with Wagner and Operetten being most popular) architecture (Speer and Germania) and sculpting (Arno Breker).  Having said that I am not aware of Hitler using his personal art for propaganda purposes. However I did find a mention that Hitler made a draft for a swastika flag in 1920 (http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46408313.html). This seems to be an exception however.  As he became more famous after the first World War Hitler tried to suppress sources on his life before the war. In 1938 he tried to rebuy all paintings done by him. The existence as a poor and not very talented or famous painter did not fit with his status as dictator anymore.
DiddyDom007,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 19:23,It may well have made it worse but to my knowledge anti-Semitism is an ancient prejudice. Jews have been persecuted for millennia- the Romans the Crusades the Nazis just to name the most famous.  Without going into too much detail the Arab-Jewish conflict is one which runs deep in the veins of history and Hitler in the Middle East was probably only a very small fragment of the anti-Semitism there.  Hope this helps.
teddybear202,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 20:02,In 'Bloodlands' Snyder writes that in one particularly bad German POW camp there were more Soviet deaths in a day than all the Western Allies suffered throughout the war in camps. As far as the reason in Mein Kampf Hitler said he estimated 45 million Slavs would have to be 'eliminated' and the rest enslaved. Red Army troops were made aware of this through propaganda and knew the war was absolutely to the death no POWs could expect to be treated according to the Geneva Convention. 
ldwr011,history,2015-03-16 21:53,So basically a little after Germany broke their non-aggression pact against the USSR Germany backed the USSR all the way up to the city of Stalingrad. This city was important to the soviets as it was named after their leader and to give it up would be an embarrassment. So the soviets put out their all and utmost power into protecting Stalingrad. When the Germans fought for Stalingrad they lost to the soviets. This was known as the turning point in the war. This is because from then on the USSR and the other allied forces pushed the Germans to the point of Hitler shooting himself and the war in Europe was done. This was also known as V-E Day. (Victory in Europe Day) 
hatheaded,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 2:15,The Nazi's came to power during a very interesting and dynamic time in the modern art movement. Western art in particular painting had become less representational and more abstract. Hitler who considered himself an artist was a fierce opponent of this type of art and it was suppressed to varying degrees during the Nazi regime. The Nazi regime termed this as degenerate art. Ironically much of the art was confiscated but not actually destroyed - it could be profitably auctioned.  It is also well known that when the Nazis would invade and occupy other nations they would often loot the museums of valuable art much of which made it into the personal vaults of high ranking Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering was particularly notorious in this regard. That may not be relevant for your essay but it does shed considerable background on the venality and greed of some of the Nazi leaders.  The Nazi regime viewed the arts as a propaganda tool and suppressed art that did not directly agree with and support their ideology. They tended to prohibit and suppress modern art not classical works and they did so for political and aesthetic purposes. Obviously works by Jewish artists were particularly suppressed.  ISIS have destroyed works of ancient art on religious grounds and perhaps also as a form of publicity seeking knowing there would be a strong reaction and media coverage of their deeds. They interpret Islam as forbidding any work that represents a living thing as idolatry. Please note this is not a mainstream view of most Islamic thought it is an extreme and very minority view.  Here are some sources on the Nazi policies for degenerate art:   * http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007519   * https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10077   * http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/    Here are some sources on the theological ideas behind ISIS's destruction of idolatry:   * http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21645749-jihadists-are-attacking-more-regions-people-destroying-historys   * http://www.law.utah.edu/destroying-the-past-isis-and-our-heritage/ * http://news.yale.edu/2015/03/16/isis-destruction-cultural-antiquities-qa-eckart-frahm  Contrasting historical Christian iconoclasms with modern Islamic fundamentalism:   * http://sites.utexas.edu/culturescontexts/tag/idolatry/ 
cub1986,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 11:52,The German historian Eberhard Jäckel wrote an excellent book on Hitler's plans called *Hitler's World View: A Blueprint for Power*. He explained why Hitler felt it necessary to extinguish the Jews. Whereas Marx viewed history as class struggle Hitler instead viewed history as racial struggle. Jäckel elaborates:  &gt It is on this basis that the programmatic thinker Hitler confirms and defines for the political Hitler the dual yet also unified task of his life. He had to annihilate the Jews thus restoring the meaning of history and within the thus restored nature-intended struggle for existence he at the same time had to conquer new living space for the German people. Each of these tasks was inextricably linked to the other  indeed they were the mutually necessary preconditions for each other. Unless the Jews were annihilated there would very soon no longer be any struggle for living space nor therefore any culture and consequently nations would die out  not just the German nation but ultimately all nations. But if on the other hand the German people failed to conquer new living space it would die out because of that and the Jews would triumph.
Esco91,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:35,I hope [this](http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1944-06-01/1948-06-01?basicsearch=%2bstauffenberg&amp freesearch=stauffenberg&amp sortorder=score&amp contenttype=article%2cillustrated%2cmiscellaneous) links correctly.  It's a link to the British Newspaper archive for mentions of Stauffenberg by name between 1/10/44 and 1/10/45 doesn't show the national press but one of the papers (Yorkshire Post) was as good as in those days indeed hey broke the abdication affair scandal in the 30s. Theres over 50 different stories on the topic on there and this is from before the days of newspaper syndication in the UK so they will all be different.  Unfortunately I'm too poor to pay the annual 80 Euro or monthly 10 Euro subscription fee but If you are so inclined and able to do so yourself please do let me know more about the one titled 'Hitler Lost His Pants'.....
Esco91,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 13:57,Well I've been doing a bit of digging among the stuff that is free on the site and found the [Dundee Courier](http://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2013/08/07/plot-assassinate-hitler/) one.
JFVarlet,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 18:35,Well it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks more the lower-middle officers especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy even though there's a King Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan on the other hand there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.
rugger647,history,2015-03-09 19:23,George Carlin... “The next time they give you all that civic bullshit about voting keep in mind that Hitler was elected in a full free democratic election” 
ChurchillianGrooves,history,2015-03-09 19:57,Sort of agree.  Imperialism was already winding down for a number of reasons  1. Post-colonialism: allows the exploitation of countries without directly taking them over (think Nike factories or Foxconn in Asia)   2. Growing opposition among the population in Imperialist countries (whether due to political ideology or just on a cost basis)  3. Colonies acquiring greater infrastructure and technology making them less dependent on the Imperial powers  4.  Growing nationalism in colonies   5.  Economies becoming more dependent on machinery (and skilled workers) than manpower (as in an agrarian society)  I'm sure there are more but these are the larger reasons I could come up with off the top of my head.  I wouldn't say Hitler caused the end of Imperialism.  WWI and WWII certainly sped up the process though.  While I do agree with you that British and French colonialism were horrible and often glossed over they were no where near as bad as the Nazis or even the Soviets.  Many millions of people were outright killed or starved to death in concentration camps and gulags.  Many of the independence movements in the colonies were already well underway even before WWI so you can't really say that Hitler lead to their independence.  Ho Chi Minh was at the treaty of Versaille at the end of WWI arguing for Vietnamese independence after all.  The Indian independence movement was also active pre WWI. 
Genessender,history,2015-03-09 22:42,Nevertheless in 1939 and 1940 slightly more than half of all immigrants to the United States were Jewish most of them refugees from Europe. In 1941 45% of all immigrants to the United States were Jewish. After the United States entered the war in December 1941 the trickle of immigration virtually dried up just at the time that the Nazi regime began systematically to murder the Jews of Europe. Despite many obstacles however more than 200000 Jews found refuge in the United States from 1933 to 1945 most of them before the end of 1941.  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005182  People recognized long before the start of the war that Hitler was threatening genocide. Hitler himself said so. 
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 5:51,Makes for a good joke but Hitler was appointed not elected.
zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 13:22,His party was by far the largest party in Germany. Hindenburg named him Chancellor due to pressure from his conservative/army buddies who thought they could use Hitler's large number of elected representatives to rule.  IIRC the parliament was completely paralyzed because there was no government that could be formed at that point with an absolute majority so the only way to get anything done was to rule by presidential decree. Everyone wanted a democratic ruler and the conservatives compromised by making a coalition with the nazis where he got the chancellery and they got most of the ministries giving that coalition the elected weight to rule without decree.  So he didn't have absolute majority but it was an impossible feat for the most part to get a majority with tens of parties all getting votes.  source : Rise and fall of the Third Reich
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 16:09,This election was actually a political loss for the NSDAP furthermore the SPD and KPD were gradually cooperating with each-other which was a potential immediate future threat to them. This naturally changed with Hitlers appointment to Chancellor at the urgings of various leading members of Government and it only took a year for him to consolidate power using his new position.
zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 16:22,What????  The Socialists actually despised the Communists MOST of all. They perceived them as their main threat even though the nazi star had started shining again and quickly moved past them. Without question something that helped Hitler gain seats and eventually the chancellery since his 2 main opponents were divided and unwilling to cooperate.  source : same as above
YxxzzY,history,2015-03-10 17:15,Most know that they didn't have any choice. Especially when Hitler made almost all male persons that were able to hold and shoot a gun go to war.     People don't generally like to talk about the war itself here they talk about the regime there are no war-heroes like you might have in the US or any other allied nation.   Even tho my Grandfathers uncle was an ace no one ever told me until I started googling my surname  and asked a few questions. I think that is pretty cool but my parents and especially my grandparents  all of them born after the war think it's part of a bad and scary past they would rather forget about.  Just some unorganized thoughts  ). 
Gettodacchopper,history,2015-03-10 21:38,The short version is that he warned about Hitler and Germany when few wanted to think about it. 
TheChosenOne127,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 23:47,Actually Hitler was convinced that the landings was happening at Calais. It's the main reason that some panzer divisions were not in Normandy at the time of D-Day. The operation was referred to as Operation Fortitude. Things could've gone a lot worse during D-Day.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:06,The timeline you mentioned is somewhat off but the story itself is true. Hitler saw the prototype on November 26. 1943. He asked if the plane could be fitted with bombs. When the company answered yes Hitler agreed on the production if the design was turned into a Blitzbomber.  Numerous people within the Luftwaffe disagreed and tried to persuade Hitler to use the plane as a fighter but it took until early 1945 until the Me 262 was used in the role it had been designed for. And while it was very dangerous as an interceptor there were too few to have a real impact on the war. The main advantages were the high speed which allowed the Me 262 to outrun escort fighters and the heavy armament.  Why did Hitler act this way? First Hitler in 1944 was not a very stable person. The strain of commanding the german army for years had taken its toll and he was abusing a lot of medical products. According the statements by people in his vicinity he was prone to fits of rage and depression and was very capable of acting irrational. Many people have classified him as clinically insane by this point.   While the actual motivations will remain unknown german-language sources claim that Hitler had a large desire for revenge against the western Allies. He hoped that the Me 262 would be able to bomb England and the allied forces with impunity - even though the payload was low and the design was not optimised for bombing runs.
throwthetrash15,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:35,I like the answer. And I also understand that he indeed wanted a jet powered bomber that speed past allied fighters and bomb London- eventually New York- but what I don't understand is given the Me262's track record when it first was tested in actual combat he didn't actually bring to a reasonable production level. From my understanding he believed that repelling Overlord would mean a catastrophic loss for the Allies. This would allow him to focus in the East and potentially win the war. In the book D-Day Ambrose states that the Allies needed Air SUPREMACY (which they had at a great cost) over France to succeed with D-Day Hitler knew this as well. Why did he not see that a Jet fighter at this point could potentially challenge and quickly bring the superiority to him?
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:49,The Me 262 was barely ready for frontline service in summer 1944. Even if Hitler had decided to use the Me 262 as a fighter it would not have been avaiable in large enough numbers to change the outcome of the war.   You should also consider that Germany did not have the resources or the manpower to keep building the proven piston-engined fighters and set up a completely new production for jet fighters. The numerical superiority of allied fighters was simply too large.  And - last but not least - pilots had to be trained for the new plane. A jet fighter behaves very differently to a piston-engined fighter and Germany did not have a surplus of trained pilots quite to the contrary.
norhis,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 10:09,According to Grunnbok i Norges Historie page 292-293 you are correct. Quisling was the leader of a party called National Assembly Nasjonal Samling in Norwegian. On the 9th of April he proclaimed himself as the new prime minister of a government who was willing to co-operate with the Reich. The Norweigan Supreme Court did not like Quisling much. On the 15th of April they voted to assemble an Administrative Councel. On April 24 Hitler made Josef Terboven Reichkommisar. The Germans wanted to distance themselfs from Quisling in order to establish a connection with the legitimate Norwegian government instances. This was mostly so they with the cooperation of the Parliament could establish a government and work against the Norwegian Government in London.   Sources:   Helle et al. 2013.

kieslowskifan,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 11:08,The story of the Me-262's use as a bomber is somewhat convoluted and exaggerated in postwar memoirists such as Adolf Galland. In February 1943 a *Führerbefehl* decreed that all fighter aircraft should provision for bomb racks so they could be used as fighter-bombers. Willy Messerschmitt then incorporated the provision for bomb racks into the design and began development on paper for pure bomber variants of the 262.  In September 1943 Messerschmitt personally assured Hitler that the 262 could be used as a high-speed bomber over southern England.  When Hitler saw a 262 on display he inquired whether it could carry bombs and Messerschmitt again affirmed that the 262 could carry a decent bomb load. From all this Hitler got the impression that the 262 was analogous to the Ar234 a bomber that would use speed to evade enemy defenses. By January 1944 at a conference with Milch and Speer Hitler stressed that the bomb load of the 262 should be increased so when a *Jagerstab* conference on aircraft production the following May noted that the 262 was to be a fighter Hitler thought his orders were being deliberately flaunted. Milch tried to argue the case for the 262 as a fighter but Hitler would have none of it. Goering subsequently sent out a directive stating The Führer has ordered that the Me 262 is to be operated purely as a high-speed bomber. There is to be no mention of it as a fighter until further notice.   So what impact did this have on the deployment of the 262? Not very much. The bomber variants of the 262 were already in development long before the May 1944 *Jagerstab* conference. The 262 program like many high-technology programs was beset by technical issues which were compounded by Germany's shortages of strategic materials.  The greatest problem for the 262 was what made it so revolutionary: its engines. The Junkers Jumo 004 selected for the 262 after its intended powerplant the  BMW 003 fell hopelessly behind schedule was a persnickety design and ersatz materials gave it a very short design life. The bugs within the engine were difficult to iron out and prevented any full-scale deployment of the 262 in early 1944.  Furthermore a shortage of trained workers and the pressures of dispersal of factories caused by Allied bombing put a ceiling on how many 262s could be produced.   The 262 as bomber entered into postwar memory as an example of Hitler's strategic myopia. Postwar Luftwaffe veterans would argue that but for the  Führer the 262 could have entered into production earlier and turned the tide of the air war. Writers such as Ambrose uncritically repeated this  line was but the reality was the 262 arguably went into service as early as it could have given the circumstances. Luftwaffe pilots also had great difficulty coming up with new tactics and formations which to use the 262 effectively. The convoluted nature of the 262's bomber interlude does indict the Third Reich on a different set of charges. The polycratic nature of the Third Reich where there were multiple centers of power all dependent upon Hitler's approval meant that German officials were inclined to try and court the Führer's opinion. Messerschmitt like many other technical experts in the aviation industry often misled or exaggerated aviation developments to suit Hitler's expectations. In the example of the 262 Willy Messerschmitt conflated paper projects for a pure 262 bomber with the emerging new design which just had bomb racks.   *Sources*  Boyne Walter J. *Messerschmitt Me 262: Arrow to the Future*.
