ManifestMagnetist,history,2015-03-15 13:51,War progresses human civilization......? War destroys everthing human society stands for.....you are speaking some serious newspeak I appreciate you being humble about it though.   Ask the populaces of France or italy like Louis the 14 being beheaded by the french revolution or Mussolini being hung by a meat hook by the Italians about what they think of great men :)
MashBlaster,history,2015-03-15 14:05,i only say war progresses human civ in a way that expediates the process. humans would have found each other without armies on the move we would have traded other things along the way (not just war materials taxes etc) and exchanged culture as well. i would argue though that without war we probably wouldnt have cell phones or tvs or radio or modern infastructure or modern farming techniques and logistics in governing hundreds of millions per state.  also i dont know who considers Mussolini a great man he was kind of weak willed IMO and couldnt even hold a stick to Hitler(not even the greatest man of his Generation[Churchill]) so i wont draw those comparisons:)
lsop,AskHistorians,2015-03-15 23:40,This was one of the reasons Mussolini was so loved. A church in Canada even painted [a mural](http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca/collection/details/dicea2012_0024_0001) commemorating the event.  
VoightKampffTest,AskHistorians,2015-03-16 14:48,Perhaps the alleged Business Plot. Retired Marine Major General  and two time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley Butler (author of [War is a Racket!](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html)) and journalist Paul French testified at the House Special Committee on Un-American Activities that a group of powerful businessmen and industrialists had contacted them about a plan to launch a coup against President Franklin Roosevelt.   Butler was a widely admired war hero and they thought he was the man they needed to rally and organize veterans into a movement akin to the Weimar-era Germany Freikorps. Once they had the muscle the plan was to either depose Roosevelt or turn him into their puppet enacting fascistic reforms modeled after those of Mussolini's Italy.   &gt French testified that MacGuire stated **“We need a fascist government in this country to save the Nation from the Communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America. The only men who have patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader. He could organize one million men over night.**  &gt Continuing French stated that during the conversation MacGuire told him about his trip to Europe and of the studies that he had made of the Fascist Nazi and French movements and the parts that the veterans had played in them. &gt ... &gt French further testified that MacGuire considered the movement entirely and tremendously patriotic and that any number of people with big names would be willing to help finance it. French stated that during the course of the conversation MacGuire continually discussed the need of a man on a white horse and quoted MacGuire as having said **We might go along with Roosevelt and then do with him what Mussolini did with the King of Italy.**  &gt MacGuire according to French expressed the belief that half of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars would follow General Butler if he would announce the plan that MacGuire had in mind.  *Testimony of Paul Comly French - Page 21.*  &gt I said The idea of this great group of soldiers then is to sort of frighten him is it?  &gt No no no  not to frighten him. This is to sustain him when others assault him.  &gt He said**You know the President is weak. He will come right along with us.** He was born in this class. He was raised in this class and he will come back. He will run true to form. In the end he will come around. But we have got to be prepared to sustain him when he does.  *Testimony of Maj. Gen. S. D. Butler (Retired) - Page 4*  Again we have very few sources on the existence of the alleged plot beyond the HUAC hearings let alone how far along the conspirators were in serious preparations but if Butler &amp  French's testimony was truthful the Business Plot would doubtless be one of the top candidates.   **Sources**  Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Other Certain Propaganda Activites (PDF Warning)  * [Part 1](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC1.pdf) * [Part 2](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC2.pdf) * [Part 3](http://www.flagrancy.net/salvage/HUAC3.pdf)  [Transcript of the above documents](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/McCormack%E2%80%93Dickstein_Committee#Public_Statement_on_Preliminary_findings_of_HUAC.2C_November_24.2C_1934) 
JFVarlet,AskHistorians,2015-03-17 18:35,Well it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks more the lower-middle officers especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy even though there's a King Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan on the other hand there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.
jonewer,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:21,&gt  Are the likes of John Laffin Denis Winter Alan Clark and Liddell Hart really the entire reason for the emergence of that perspective?  Haig's descent from national hero *sans pareil* to comic book super-villain is something that I have been causally looking at recently hence my recent [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ynojf/when_did_the_war_poets_like_sassoon_and_owen/) on this sub about war poets.  So after the war he was much feted with some even fearing he might turn to politics and become a Mussolini type figure.   After his death we the publication of Lloyd-George's memoirs in the 1930's which is also when people like Edmonds and Liddell-Hart start cooking up mischief. Also of published at the time is Baker-Carr's book from which the (in)famous alleged quote about Haig and machine guns is to be mined. Nevertheless Haig's reputation holds up reasonably well in the 30's.  However it's really in the 1960's where things turn bad what with the publication of books by Clarke and Taylor while 'Oh what a Lovely War' achieves considerable popularity. There are some indication that Wilfred Owen's poetry becomes very popular at around this time.  It's maybe of note that the change in how Haig and the war was viewed coincided with the loss of large chunks of the Empire as well as with the general 1960's liberal consensus.  By the time Blackadder goes forth is broadcast in 1989 many school children's only exposure to the Great War is reading Owen's poetry in English classes with History classes picking up at Versailles through to Munich...  In 1998 (80 years after Victory) the Daily Express had a headline calling for Haig's statue to be removed with Clarke advocating it be vandalised as Haig was a mass murderer.  &gt  I recognize that the ‘Butcher’ Haig angle is very much on the decline right now but I still run into more moderate versions of it regularly  For the most part the 'rehabilitationist' view of Haig is confined to those who can actually be bothered to read a history book ie. a very small section of the population.  For the most part people's reactions to Haig are very much along the lines of Donkey through War Criminal to Mass Murderer and its hard to engage with such an ingrained concept in people who frankly aren't very interested in the first place.
