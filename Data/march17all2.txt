readher;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 12:04:06;I can tell you about the situation with Poland, although I belive some of the points will apply to the other countries aswell.  After 1795 and the third partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a large part of the former union was a part of Russian Empire. The level of authonomy changed throughout later periods (for example Congress Poland was created after Congress of Vienna giving a bit more freedom and autonomy) but it never satisfied Polish community which had a long history of their country and consisted of many patriots. Numerous uprisings occured and although most of them were unsuccessful, they still meant a lot of effort had to be put to maintain order in that part of the Empire.  Unlike germanisation, the russification process was never really successful and most of the polish community resisted any attempts to destroy their national pride.  After World War I when Poland gained independence and the Second Polish Republic was formed, they faced a great loss during the Poland-Bolshevik war where a newly formed nation with a lot of problems managed to defeat a mighty russian army.  Another show of polish will to fight any aggressor was the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. Despite proving unsuccessful (due to the fact that the soviet army did not intervene as the polish resistance members assumed) , it streghten the thought that it would cost too much to maintain order should Poland be annexed by the USSR. It was much easier to create a pupped state with a bit of autonomy.  The USSR still had Poland in pretty much absolute control without all the problems that would be present had it been annexed. We also have to remember that there was a polish government on the exile in the Great Britain and during early meetings during WW2 Poland was to be part of the western bloc. That was changed later when Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed us (once again) and gave the case of Poland into Stalin's hands.  He knew that creation of puppet state would solve the problem of the government on the exile and all previous problems I've stated aswell.  It's my first post in this subreddit. English isn't my first language but I tried my best to make as low amount of errors as possible. I've read the subreddit rules and it stated that every answer should provide sources. I don't think it would make much sense in this case though as I know most of this from polish books that I'm almost 100% positive have no translations. If you ever want to ask something about Poland in any of the periods feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to tell you more.;

But rare indeed will be the Canadian whose family tree hasn't brushed up against brutality or suffering of some kind. Ours is a settler society. Were everything hunky dory in the old country, its likely that many of our forefathers wouldn't have chosen to transplant themselves to what not so long ago was a harsh and uncivilized hinterland.   Unfortunately, the physical space around our important capital institutions simply isn't large enough to accommodate a memorial to every injustice or tragedy that's befallen humanity. The decision to single out one persecuted group for a memorial ["nearly equal in size to the War Memorial plaza on Elgin, and almost three times the size of the Peacekeeping Memorial on Sussex"](http://spacing.ca/ottawa/2015/03/13/12884/) is arbitrary and betrays our obligation to curate this space in the interests of all Canadians.   ;

cefgaw;politics;2015-03-17 12:17:43;It comes from Churchill's speech.  [A government minister had incautiously referred to this period of inaction as “years that the locusts had eaten.”](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/414471/americas-locust-years-jim-talent).  The NRO article is clearer and less bombastic argument for increase in military spending.  Though it also only talks about U.S. military spending less than what it was rather than lower than any other country.  Military spending has been reduced due to 2011 Budget Control Act, not in-action.  So I still don't see the Churchill parrallel.  The way Cotton uses it, it sounds like he's calling anyone getting government assitance as a locust.;

Because of the Soviet victory, it eventually led to equal rights movement, and everything else went downhill from there.  ;

Khrushchev at least extended an invitation to Mao to travel to Russia and talk.  Mao's the one who screwed it up just because he couldn't accept Khrushchev criticizing Stalin's policies.    Mao's ego was so incredibly large that no one could penetrate it. Although he had been trying to have China stray away Stalin's policies (he would repeatedly say that Stalin policies gave the foundation, but the Chinese people must forge their own path), he still believed in them. Mao's words contradicted his actions numerous times throughout his life.  He is the reason why China was so fucked during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and is still having issues today.  ;

readher;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 12:26:56;The parts of Germany gave to Poland was compensation demanded by the Western Allies for taking easter territories of Poland. Today's Kaliningrad Oblast' was to be part of Poland aswell (with the city of Kaliningrad bearing name Królewiec) although Stalin changed his mind in the last moment and decided to add this territory to the RSFSR. Lwów which is considered to be the one of the two main (along with Kraków) cities where the Polish elite was being raised has been given to the Ukrainian SSR as it had claim on it and meant that one of the very important places where the polish patriotism could be continiued ceased to exist.  The case of Baltics while might seem complicated was pretty simple. The countries had fairy low population and even though each of them had very different culture with and unlike Ukraine/Belarus had nothing in common with Russia, they couldn't pose any real threat. The USSR also played the "better safe than sorry card" and made the Baltic States a place where Soviet Army officers were sent for retirement. This resulted in fairly large russian minority being still present in these countries today. Stalin did almost the same thing with Crimea, although he took a step further there and instead of only moving russian citizens there, he expelled most of the Tatar people from there to Siberia in fear of organized resistance (as the Tatar community, much like the Poles are known for their ferocity in fights against opressors).  As for the Chechens i fear that although I know a bit of their cause, my knowledge is not sufficent to provide you a quality answer. I can only guess that they underestimated them and it serves them right to this day since they have constant insurgency in that area.;

Basically the 12t has stats it can work with, and a good player can make the tank work well because it has speed and a decent gun, even if it's no T37. The BDR on the other hand has nothing but its gun to work with and almost everything else about the tank is working against it or doesn't help much, especially when it's not top tier.  The BDR is also competing with some very good tanks too. The KVs are all great, the Churchill 1 has a pretty good gun too even if the armor is crap, and the tracks are better trolls than those on the BDR. The T1 Heavy at least has a decent gun and good gun depression, along with fantastic mobility. That pretty much leaves the Premium tanks, which are supposed to be worse than the regular ones, and the VK 30.01 H, which is at least a smaller target than the BDR with a good gun.;

my_baby_ate_dingos;france;2015-03-17 12:59:23;J'ai en effet souvent dans l'idée qu'une 2e guerre mondiale finie en 1940 se solde invariablement par une guerre froide qui évolue en 3e guerre mondiale. Industrialisée, militarisée, avec Staline à sa tête, l'URSS était l'ennemi naturel de l'Europe de l'Est.  Sans alliance Allemagne-Japon, Roosevelt n'a aucune excuse pour pousser à une stricte alliance militaire avec la France et le Royaume-Uni après Pearl Harbor. Les US se lancent donc dans une guerre bilatérale contre le Japon. L'Europe de l'Est est libérée du Reich par les Occidentaux et non par les Rouges, donc pas de pacte de Varsovie.   Seulement, y'a encore des troupes russes en Pologne, et je pense pas que Staline aurait lâché ses gains territoriaux suite à l'invasion de 39 une fois l'Allemagne écroulée.  Avec Daladier et Chamberlain encore à la tête de la France et le Royaume-Uni, le pacifisme européen est encore vivace, mais sous cinq à dix ans la question polonaise finirait par relancer les machines de guerre. Surtout si les US finissent par battre le Japon (avec ou sans l'arme nucléaire, d'ailleurs) et menacent l'URSS à l'est.  Ca serait comme toute guerre au sol contre la Russie, une boucherie...;

Moreover, Germany, did have separation of powers, which didn't prevent Hitler's rise--so it's not clear they do anything anyone once a popular figure starts murdering the opposition. I see why the first large democratic republic, experimenting would want them.

It grew out of rival [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism) ambitions of the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire) and the [Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan) over [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria) and [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea). The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [Liaodong Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula) and [Mukden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden)  and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [Yellow Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea).  &gt Russia sought a [warm water port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_water_port)  on the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), for their navy as well as for maritime trade. [Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok) was only operational during the summer season, but [Port Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCshunkou) was operational all year. From the end of the [First Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War) in 1903, negotiations between Russia and Japan had proved impractical. Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in Manchuria dating back to the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century. Through threat of Russian expansion, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as in the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused this, farther demanding Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to its strategic interests and chose to go to war. After negotiations broke down in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur, a naval base in Liaotung Province leased to Russia by China, in a surprise attack.  &gt The resulting campaigns, in which the Japanese military attained complete victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. Over time, the consequences of these battles transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. Scholars today debate the historical significance of the Russo-Japanese War.  &gt Russia suffered numerous defeats at the hands of Japan and remained engaged in the war due in part to the will of the tsar, Nicholas II. After faring poorly early in the war, Nicholas II, convinced that Russia would ultimately obtain victory in the war, chose to remain engaged in the war  at first, to await the outcomes of certain naval battles, and later on, upon realizing imminent defeat, it has been debated, to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a "humiliating peace". The Russo-Japanese War concluded with the [Treaty of Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Portsmouth), mediated by U.S President [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) at the [Portsmouth Naval Shipyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Naval_Shipyard) on [Seavey's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seavey%27s_Island), [Kittery, Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittery,_Maine), while the delegates stayed in [Portsmouth, New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire).  &gt ====  &gt [**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/mDR4qtL.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RUSSOJAPANESEWARIMAGE.jpg)  ---  ^Interesting: [^Shuishiying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuishiying) ^| [^Russian ^battleship ^Peresvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Peresvet) ^| [^Russian ^battleship ^Poltava ^\(1894)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Poltava_\(1894\)) ^| [^Russian ^battleship ^Sevastopol ^\(1895)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Sevastopol_\(1895\))   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cphtw5z) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp message=%2Bdelete+cphtw5z)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/);

YRM_DM;Christianity;2015-03-17 13:26:27;Maybe we're just using different terms.  Religious freedom is a positive thing that makes progress possible.  When Religious freedom is not possible... either through things like atheist Stalin, or cult-like Hitler, or in the Salem Witch Trials, or in Sharia Law states today, or in the days of the Inquisition.   That is when progress suffers.  And I am 100% for religious freedom.  If someone ever tried to pass a law saying you couldn't go to church, pray with family and friends, worship in your home, etc.  I'd be right there with you protesting.  I may not think it's truth, but, you have every right to believe what you want.   We live in a great country where debate is possible.  What I'm trying to say is that, when strongly religious people get power and try to enforce their strictest morality in law... like, in Afghanistian where the Taliban were executing homosexuals in soccer stadiums.   Or during the dark ages...  or in Salem during the witch trials.  People are shut down.  Progress is halted.  It can be anyone shutting this down, as long as they are a fervent believer in whatever...   Kim Jong Il thinks he's a god, so he dominates all other religion out of his culture and promoted myth about himself.  Freedom &gt   non-freedom  It doesn't really matter what the belief systems are, within that freedom... as has been pointed out, when Islam was less radical, they were at the leading edge of technology and progress in the world.

klapaucius;comicbooks;2015-03-17 13:29:04;&gt  Simon noted, "When the first issue came out we got a lot of ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for." The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support."   This is important to note. While it's not like the American people were all firmly isolationist at the time, Captain America #1 predates the Pearl Harbor attack that happened that December, and the US involvement in WWII. So having someone who represents America and all it stands for punching out Hitler was actually a powerful political statement, not just patriotic propaganda.;

readher;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 13:34:09;I guess you could say that but I belive that was the case. France and Great Britain were to attack Germany right away should they invade Poland. Before the attack took place Marshall Piłsudski insisted that Poland and France should make preventive invasion of Germany due to them ignoring Treaty of Versailles conditions which were dismissed by France. After Germany invaded Poland all that Western Allies did was declare war and take no military action. Everyone in Poland was sure that they only need to hold the invasion for a short time to stall German offensive allowing France and Britain to take necessary action. After Poland was defeated the government on the exile created Polish forces which fought extraordinary in various battles during the war. Battle of Britain was won thanks to Polish and Czechoslovakian pilots ("Never, in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few." was the words Churchill said after victory). They also fought in Arnhem (6. SBS led by General Sosabowski), in Narvik (1. Polish Independent Highland Brigade), Tobruk (3. Polish Carpathian Infantry Division) and Falaise (1. Armoured Division led by General Maczek). The fought alongside the very people who betrayed their beloved country because they belived that they won't betray them again. They fought to the very end without knowing that the decision to hand Poland to the eastern bloc under russian rule was already made during Yalta Conference. After this all, don't you think that betrayal is the correct used word here?;

DrHoppenheimer;askaconservative;2015-03-17 13:48:36;They're a liberal democracy - the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. They are politically stable. They are allies and friends.  There was a partition plan following the second world war. The Mandate of Palestine was former Ottoman territory, administered by the British under a League of Nations mandate, and there was a proposal by the newly formed UN to partition the land into two states:  1. A Jewish state, consisting of majority-Jewish regions. 2. A Muslim state, consisting of majority-Muslim regions.  While the partition plan was never formally accepted (it was accepted by the international community at large and the local Jewish population, but was rejected by the Muslim population and the surrounding nations). But it was a reasonable and fair plan, and the proposed partition borders closely matched the borders of Israel when they declared their independence.  (let's also not forget that the Muslim Arab population, led by Grand Mufti Haj Amin Al-Husseini, President of the Supreme Muslim Council of Palestine, were allies of Hitler and the Nazi's in WW2. Al-Husseini was particularly fond of Hitler's "Final Solution.")  But at the end of the day, Israel exists. Its people live there, and they have lived there their entire lives, as have their parents, and as will their children. Discussion about "historical claim" is irrelevant unless you support ethnic cleansing.  The "multicultural state" is a modern - and flawed - idea. The whole point of states is to create political borders at cultural and ethnic divides. There is an enormous body of research which shows that political borders decrease violence and create stability. Mismatch between culture and country creates unnecessary domestic political tension  shared cultures have shared values, which are embodied in local laws and government decisions. You only have to look at Africa to see how badly drawn borders can lead to decades of brutal internal conflict. And civil wars tend to be the nastiest wars of all.  That isn't to mean that countries shouldn't protect the civil and political rights of minorities. But countries should have a dominant culture, either through historical inheritance (old world) or the melting pot (new world).  The two state solution is the only viable solution that can secure a permanent peace.;

G3nji_17;BokuNoHeroAcademia;2015-03-17 13:54:06;I have some criticism for the quiz, first of you should say the full name of students or at least the names that are primarily used in the manga. Saying just somebody's first name when litterally everyone refers to them with their last name is not nice. It could make for some interesting questions of itself thought, something like what is Izukus last name or somebody else.  Secondly I don't think the questions about the subreddit or podcasts are that great in a quiz about the manga, I honestly was expecting to be quizzed about the manga and not this subreddit.  Thrid while the best girl question was quite funny and I am aware it is only worth 1 point I actually like the idea you had in your response to /u/Joseph_Stalin_ a lot more, the winner of the quiz can pick a character that the last question will be about.  So far to the questions themself. Now general form.   The timer was way to harsh, there is no indication that there will be a timer at the beginning and since the site was beeing really really slow I spend about half of my quiz time waiting for the site to load the next question. This could be solved by just giving the players the last page where you can check your answers right away.  You should provide more info at the beginning of the quiz, usually people do the quiz and then check the comments after to avoid spoilers so providing info in the comments doesn't really work.  I also really liked the Lunch-Rush question with the picture. I think doing more things with the pictures would be great.  Thank you for spending you time doing this :) It would be really awesome if this got to be a regular and popular thing and I hope my feedback helps you improve it.;
Sethdood;pics;2015-03-17 13:56:25;I've lived in Flushing, Queens for my entire life. I can tell you that this disgusting ridiculous bullshit down near Main is absolutely no surprise. For those who don't know, downtown Flushing houses a massive pocket of Chinese immigrants, surrounded by a far-reaching (almost two-three towns wide) halo of Korean immigrants. Chinatown in Manhattan is really just a few dirty disgusting garbage packed streets, and if you want to see that type of low-class barbarism spread out a bit more, come to Flushing, where local authorities have been more lenient about letting them be themselves.   When I worked in Long Island City, I would spend an extra 5 dollars on travel to skip the worst part of my day: Walking just three blocks down Main Street to get to the 7 Train subway on Roosevelt Ave (where this picture was taken). Every few feet, there are piles and piles of black garbage bags, which is nice because at least sometimes the garbage makes it into a bag, but the stink coming from the pile is usually fucking revolting. The sidewalk and gutters are covered in grime and sludge, gross garbage juice which has just rotted and stained everything black. It's not uncommon to actually see dead fish on the floor, next to little glossy handouts for happy-ending massage parlors and crumpled wrappers. I always had to long-step over something nasty, every day. Not a single part of any of it it smells okay. Not a single part of it doesn't have a patina of purified waste covering it.   The sidewalk is where most of my attention is, because if I look up for too long I'd step in something gross, as stated. Aside from that, whats happening in the crowds is fuckin horrifying. EVERYONE does the thing where they loudly bring up phlegm and spit, it's fucking constant. Weird screaming in Chinese, awkward wails and complete lack of self awareness- check. Insanely rude bumping into you, getting in your way or otherwise hindering you- check. Shops with dead animals hanging in the window- check. The shopkeeps there clean their grimy dirty pissed on floors, and then just sloppily toss the mop bucket out the front door into the street, adding to the smell of everything else.  One time I turn a corner to get up the train station stairs, and sitting on a bottom step was some fucking gross toothless Chinese guy screaming something with his mouth FULL of Lo-mein, like not just full but with a fistfull of it just dangling out of his mouth looking like a noodle beard. Surrounding him on the stairs were flat, stepped on noodles which he already dropped, which everyone else has to walk on. I just said "Ugh guy, what the fuck" and went a different way. I'm positive he just left all of his garbage there and continued not to give a fuck.  And that's the problem, they somehow give zero fucks about how they come off doing disgusting shit. It's like when you see a movie taking place in the middle ages and everything is unsanitary and shit covered- it's modern day peasantry. Someone just took their pants off and shat in the street?! Yeah fucking OF COURSE he did. My friend linked me this picture without explanation and I responded with "Um yeah that's definitely Roosevelt and Main." Fuck that shit, and also, I don't want to go to China ever. ;
Fredfredbug4;AskReddit;2015-03-17 13:56:40;[Heil Honey, I'm home!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9jJx0NSjw) was a British sitcom that aired for one episode.

If you're not willing to watch the full episode, the jokes were very hit or miss. Though I can't think of any TV show who's Pilot was absolutely perfect. The show had potential.

Adahn5;CommunismWorldwide;2015-03-17 14:01:56;&gt  I'm going to mostly ignore this silly accusation  Gee... thanks Solid. Bloody hell, I really don't know what to say about all this if you genuinely believe Anarchists to be reactionaries. I don't know if this is a recent development of yours or if someone beat you with an 1800s stick over the head, but this is a side of you I've never seen before.  &gt It would naturally lead to anarchy, not communism  I think we would all benefit from understand what *you* consider to be Anarchism then. Please explain what you know of it, because this might be the key to understanding your misunderstandings.  &gt there will always be people telling other people how to do things.  And that's not something Anarchists necessarily oppose. In Bakunin's 'What is Authority' he clearly says so:  &gt &gt Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker  concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch  I consult several  I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions  consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person. Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings  it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.  &gt &gt If I bow before the authority of the specialists and avow my readiness to follow, to a certain extent and as long as may seem to me necessary, their indications and even their directions, it is because their authority is imposed on me by no one, neither by men nor by God. ions and even their directions Otherwise I would repel them with horror, and bid the devil take their counsels, their directions, and their services, certain that they would make me pay, by the loss of my liberty and self-respect, for such scraps of truth, wrapped in a multitude of lies, as they might give me.  &gt &gt I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason. I am conscious of my own inability to grasp, in all its detail, and positive development, any very large portion of human knowledge. The greatest intelligence would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole. Thence results, for science as well as for industry, the necessity of the division and association of labour. I receive and I give - such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn. **Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subbordination**.  So yeah, there might be someone calling the shots, but we should be able to decide democratically on who those leaders should be, and be able to jettison them if they prove themselves unworthy of that position of service and authority.  &gt The reason we call Stalin's USSR and Mao's China 'communist' is because they were trying build communism. Not because they called themselves communists.  Then following the logical conclusion to that argument you should call Anarchists communists because they're trying to build Communism, as they did with the Paris Commune, as they did in Revolutionary Catalonia, Kim Jwa Jin in Korea, and the free territories in Ukraine 1918 and Hungary in 1956, as they are in my country right here in Mexico in Chiapas currently.  &gt "We believe that the Anarchists are real enemies of Marxism" and so do I.  So you would perpetuate another Kronstadt, then? Because Anarchists are the enemies of Marxism, Solid? Is that truly and honestly what you seek?;

Trionout;flicks;2015-03-17 14:18:09;**Bonnie and Clyde** *dir. Arthur Penn, 1967*      *Bonnie and Cyde* couldn't have come in a better time. Even if the story is set in the 30's, the movie's countercultural spirit is undeniable. It has two anti-heroes who are tired of the monotony of life, and find a way of escaping in one another. In a way, Bonnie and Clyde are just two hippies.      Revolutionary in its editing that borrowed from the likes of Godard and Resnais, *Bonnie and Clyde* is different from pretty much everything that came out at the time. Penn's movie is violent, it features two anti-heroes and it's really fast-paced.      By the end of the day, however, the greatest achievement of *Bonnie and CLyde* is to make us feel fond of those characters, and understand their relationship and why they do what they do. It's like we are members of the Barrow Gang.       **5/5**      **Office Space** *dir. Mike Judge, 1999*      Apparently, having a job and a normal life wasn't a good thing in the 90's. Especially in the year 1999, where not only this movie, but also *Fight Club* and *American Beauty* dealt with the same theme of insatisfaction.      This is a pretty fun comedy about the part of the white adult male in society. Judge's visual choices are also interesting, especially how he uses slow-motion for the dramatization of pretty dumb moments. The use of music is also great, especially the hip-hop.      Overall, really good movie. **4/5**      **Rat Race** *dir.Jerry Zucker*      I watched this with my father, he said it was the best comedy he's ever seen. I don't know if I'll take his other recommendations. But hey, the Hitler jokes were funny!      **1.5/5**      **Kingsman: The Secret Service** *dir. Matthew Vaugh*      My problems with *Kingsman* come mainly from Mark Millar. It's a fun action movie and it features good performances, but it comes a certain point where everything is so over that I just couldn't stop thinking that if I were 4 years younger, I would be enjoying it a lot more.      Vaughn is a talented guy. He knows how to direct action scenes, he has a visual style and he uses music very well. The best example I can think of is the so commented church scene, where I realy think Vaufghn let himself go and turned everything up to 11. WHile the scene is good, it's almost like Vaughn is fast-forwarding everything so that A) the scene seems more frenetic and B) we don't have to see so much gore onscreen (what would kill the comic effect). Even so, Vaughn is smart enough to turn violence into something funny by stylizing it (something Tarantino does very well too).      Somehow, all of Vaughn's directorial choices are made so that he can "fix" Millar's story for the screen.      With an irregular cast (Firth and Strong are excellent, Caine and Jackson are not), and a pretty dull first act, *Kingsman* is far from the wonder that many people said it is. However, it's still a pretty funny movie with a great third act and some good moments.      **3.5/5**      **Sex, Lies and Videotape** *dir. Steven Soderbergh, 1989*      SLaV is the kind of movie that I love the most. Soderbergh's film is a study on 4 characters with unusual relations one to another. Nothing really dramatic happens, we just keep diving into those people's minds and finding out more about them as the movie goes.      The responsible for the explosion of independent filmmaking, as well as for making the Sundance film fest the Nº1 Independent festival, SLaV is an impressive debut film by Soderbergh. Here are all of the techniques that would be constant in his career, like his amazing [use of colors](http://i.imgur.com/CLQ9agw.jpg) to his camera movements that reveal tons of information about the characters.      Soderbergh's voyeuristic direction is the best thing about the film. There are no sex scenes in the film, because sex would do nothing to those characters. The talks that James Spader's character has with the women he tapes are much more intimate than a carnal relation.      Spader, by the way, gives one of the best performances (if not the best) of his career. His character is clouded by mistery, and while that would naturally make him look a threatening, Spader is constanty showing vulnerability in his small gestures. This is even more impressive if you think that his posterior career would be filled with dominant characters.      Cutting to a black screen in some of the most pivotal scenes in the movie, Soderbergh shows how much he knows about cinematic craft, and how he knows how to manipulate his audience. And God, how will I miss being manipulated by him.      **5/5**;

bandolero_device;IAmA;2015-03-17 14:22:16;Did Hitler have a right to carry out the Holocaust? If you say yes, then there is your so-called "right" to invade, massacre, terrorize, and expel the indigenous population at gunpoint. That is how this so-called state of "Israel" was created, and to be clear, no: "Israel" does not have a "right" to exist. (Neither does any other nation, by the way.)  Also, the notion of "legal borders" is hilarious as "Israel" has consistently refused to define its borders. So do you mean the 6% of the land that Jews kinda-sorta purchased? The 52% awarded by the (again, non-legitimate) UN General Assembly vote (which does not have the force of international law, in case you didn't know.) The larger percentage  they currently occupy? The territory delineated by the illegal apartheid wall?;

There is just an absence of applicants whose motivation is public service. Your statement that public service is just PC jargon just illustrates your own moral bankruptcy. It was a cultural value prior to Reagan.  Eisenhower referred to the military industrial congressional complex and later deleted the word "congressional" for political reasons. His was not a distrust of government. He distrusted the consolidation of congressional and corporate power and its potential to make armed conflict the tool of choice in resolving all international disputes.  I might add that all republican presidents since Reagan have attempted to solidify the Military Industrial Complex model.;

hopeful_nihilist;explainlikeimfive;2015-03-17 14:39:25;Well, the only really long term large Republics to compare are US, UK, and France. France, is a historical shit show, I don't even what to begin debating why its Republics fall like dominoes. But, Republics were super rare, per WW2, so most of that violent upheaval you site is really a different animal, cough Monarchy or Monarchy conquering small Republics. But you can compare the plethora of recent democracies, all of which are really hybrids of the US and UK model. South American systems tend to look more like the US, Europe more like the UK. France, is a middle ground.   South America being more unstable probably has more to do with colonial history and economics than a reflection on the system itself. The Hitler example for what it's worth, mostly shows that if 30-40% of the population prefers an Authoritarian Government, and the economy is in a tailspin, no amount of separation of powers will do anything.    But I will say this, the best and brightest Americans, working in the US government and drafting foreign policy certainly think the Parliament System is better. It's not like the UK dominated post WW2. We've gotten to straight up draft a few other countries Constitutions (Iraq, Japan, Germany) and heavily influenced most of Asia/Eastern Europe. The reason Parliamentary Systems dominate the democratic world, is because it's what America recommends, for better or worse.   ;

--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--;badphilosophy;2015-03-17 14:48:31;&gt I don't know if nuclear annihilation is in our future but no way is that risk higher than it was during the cold war.  On the one hand, that's true. On the other hand, it's also not exactly my point. We've been lucky, and so it hasn't happened yet. But there is a non-negligible chance of global nuclear war breaking out, it would absolutely fuck over Pinker's neat little graphs if it did, and he doesn't really have any good reasons that it won't.  &gt Here is my problem with your criticism of what violence is. Pinker's usage allows you to pick random people across time and ask will they die a violent death resulting from another man's intent to kill? You then end up with a clear result saying that modern humans are less likely to die that way. Now if we try to incorporate your criticisms, what do we do now?  For one thing, Pinker needs to be consistent. From page 67 that I linked before,   &gt Pinker himself doesn’t believe it, as he and his sources violate it whenever they deal with communist regimes. For these regimes (e.g., Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot), attributing indirect, non-combat- related deaths to a deliberate plan requires no imaginative leap at all—the communists are maximally guilty for all of them, and estimating deaths poses no methodological problems.  &gt Well you are less likely to die that violent death  I don't necessarily think that's true. Beginning with "Massaging the Numbers" on page 69, the linked text discusses Pinker's dishonest or shoddy use of good sources (his deliberate use of bad sources is discussed earlier), and the upshot of it all is that it doesn't seem clear that history exhibits the sort of progression Pinker thinks it does.  &gt Thus while a certain “logic of violence” may be natural to human life at an interpersonal level, there is no evidence that violence and war were central to the development of humans for the first 95 percent of the past 200,000 years—or any time before.  &gt How do you work through this ambiguity to get a quantitative result?  I don't think you can. I also don't necessarily think it's necessary to do so.  &gt What is the violence that you are claiming is resulting from globalization?  Globalization, aggressive modernization, universalizing capitalism. Not just globalization. Just to give a very quick list, I think the Korean War, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan are excellent examples. As for other, more nebulous forms of violence, I certainly think it's fair to include preventable starvation, preventable disease, and exploitation of 3rd-world workers under the heading of violence. They certainly seem to give lie to the "look how great humanity is becoming" thesis.;

TheWorldAlwaysEnds;AskScienceFiction;2015-03-17 14:50:29;Basically.   A thing most people probably don't know about Hitler is that he'd actually been sent to spy on the NSDAP by German military intelligence in the early in 1920s to keep tabs on anti-government groups, but because Germany was so incredibly fucked during the 1920s, he radicalized instead of doing his job. If the Treaty of Versailles had never been written up the way it had been, and the Germans not forced into absolute poverty, Hitler probably wouldn't have willingly joined the NSDAP and risen to power as the Fuhrer.  Circumstances are everything when it comes to human beings. We don't have many "instincts" like other animals, which is what makes us so deadly. We're the collective X-factor of nature.

baby_butt_fuck;philosophy;2015-03-17 14:54:15;&gt you think the Holocaust was the right thing for Hitler to do  Not how moral relativity works. At all. You've confused "moral given a particular moral code" with "absolutely moral", just like every other moral realist.  Yes, in Hitler's moral code, the holocaust was the "right thing for him to do". I think he was wrong. That's how moral systems work.  But that doesn't mean that anyone else has to think it was the right thing for him to do.  All you've said is "unless you think that Hitler believed the holocaust was the right thing to do", which is trivially true.  Relative to my moral code, and presumably yours, the holocaust was the wrong thing for Hitler to do.   You people keep saying "right thing for him to do" as if there is an "absolute" right thing for him to do, which is simply not the case.;

OppositeOfADwarf;AskReddit;2015-03-17 15:09:01;The key is to not go crazy with it, you have to be logical. You don't want to make the same mistake as Hitler and try to create a pure human race, that's a recipe for disaster, you want to remove the weak and the stupid, the people who will take more from society than they will give. The blind, the limbless, the clinically retarded, the morbidly obese, the mentally sick (Yes, this includes depressed people), these are all examples of the kinds of people who should be left behind.  I should mention that "leaving behind" doesn't mean killing, again, don't make the same mistake as Hitler. "Leaving behind" means prohibiting them from reproducing, this would give you ample time to correct false positives and you don't have to deal with disposing bodies.;
finjeta;russia;2015-03-17 15:09:02;Yes and you think Stalin knew this. The difference with what you know and what people at the time knew is that you know what condition finnish army was at the time they didn't. What they knew was that Finland had been fighting SU for 3 months, france was willing to send troops to help finland, "gifts" from number of countries across the world were starting to reach finland and even with 900 000 soldiers attacking for months they had only pushed barely 30 km from the original border, spring was coming and it would stop any armor from operating for weeks, at worst for month. Overall Stalin didn't see Finland falling before things would become more complicated for them and decided to take what he could to save face.;

La aplicacion de la ley da lugar a todo tipo de paradojas, asesinos comprobados, han sido absueltos o no juzgados por sobreseerse,o anular procedimiento etc, por considerar malas practicas o ilegal la forma de obtener pruebas y asi miles de casos, ¿ por eso tenemos que negar la evidencia? las definiciones no son tras pasar por un juicio, tienes asesinos o ladrones, estafadores violadores etc.. que nunca detuvieron, o no se puedo probar o salieron libres,, segun dices, no se les podria calificar de lo que son.

SJWs exploit the visceral power of words like "racism", "misogyny", "hate speech," "rape", and how easy it is to stigmatize people with those words and to silence dissent.

KaiserFritz;WritingPrompts;2015-03-17 15:30:54;He held the receiver in his hand for a second, absorbing the words that he had just heard...  "Your Mother is dead"...  His grief overflowed him like a wave, but he held his composure.  He had always had the ability to control his outside demeanor, even while his soul was awash with grief.  He had been preparing for this day, ever since he found out about his Mother's cancer.  "I will be right down." and he replaced the receiver in the cradle...He allowed himself a moment of pure anguish, allowed one wracking sob to escape, before he replaced the mask that he would show to the world.  He looked around at his small room, with it's half completed paintings and water colors he was producing to apply to art school.  At 18 years of age, he knew he was destined to be a great artist.  His work was so far superior to others of his friends that he was sure that he would have his choice of schools to attend.  "My Mother is dead"...he thought to himself.  He had lost his Father some years ago.  He was a heavy drinker, and a lout, with a Government job that made him feel more important than he was, but his lack of control made it impossible for him to be respected.    His Mother, however, was an absolute Saint.  "She was the only one who really understood me...who really cared for me"...and now she was gone.  He grabbed his coat and checked his reflection in the mirror.  He smoothed his hair.  It was too long...always fell in his eyes.  He meant to cut it, but hadn't had the time for such an unimportant thing.  He looked at his reflection.  He was a handsome young man.  and he had his Mother's eyes.    For a moment he felt another pang of grief, which he promptly locked away.  "I suppose I will have to get it cut before the funeral" he said while pulling on his coat.  He opened the door and passed out into the hall.  He listened to the music and chatter from the other rooms...Just noise really.  He had never really gotten on with his school mates.  He was so far above them.  They were worried about such petty things, none of them did anything seriously.  He was glad none of them were in the hallway, he wouldn't have wanted to talk to any of them now.  He may not be able to hold back what he really thought of them.  And when he didn't hold back, it just caused him trouble...trouble he didn't need...not now.  He sprinted down the steps, and out the door.  He saw the large black car waiting with the rear door open.  How odd.  he expected a relative, or a medical vehicle, not a limousine.  He looked into the car and saw an old man.  He recognized him as the Doctor who had been his pediatrician and family Doctor for all his life.    "Step in Son", "We need to talk".  He slid into the back seat across from the Doctor.  "I see you are rather well composed for someone who has just become an orphan." he said with that slight drawl he had.  The old Doctor smelled a bit like mothballs and dead flesh.  A smell that was off putting to most, but since he had grown up with it, to him it smelled like home.  "Looks can be deceiving" he said, in as matter of fact a voice as he could.  In no way would he let the Doctor see any emotion.  Emotion was weakness, and he would not be weak.  "That is so true, my son.  But I know you loved your Mother dearly, and her death, even if expected, cannot be easy on you."  "It is a fact of life...we knew this was coming.  Being overly melodramatic would not change that fact.  Would you have me cry like a baby?"  "No...I would not have expected anything less from you...What will you do now?"  "I will apply to art schools and become the professional artist that I have always planned to be.   Why would that change?"  It shouldn't...Have you thought about what you would do if you don't get accepted to an art school?"  "Not get accepted?!"  The thought had never occurred to him "Why would I not get accepted?"  "I was just curious if you made plans for that alternative."  He allowed the thought to circulate in his mind, even without his conscious will to do so, plans started to form within his head.  "I am sure whatever happens, i will land on my feet"...  "Of that, I have no doubt".  he realized that the car had not moved since he got in it.  "Will we be traveling today?" he asked.  The Doctor replied "Not we, but just you.  I will be catching a flight in a few hours, so I need to get to the airport.  I will check in with you in a few days when I get back, OK?"  "Suit yourself"  The Doctor slid out of the car "This car will take you to your Mother.  Your Sister is already there, she will need your help with the arrangements"  With that, he shut the door and the limo pulled away and made the corner.  The Doctor flagged down a second vehicle as it emerged from around the corner.  In the back seat was a man who was old enough to make the Doctor seem young in comparison.  He was strapped into the back seat and hooked up to an oxygen supply.  His liver spotted hands pulled the mask aside as the doctor got in.  "How is it with him?"  The Doctor fastened his seat belt and replied "It's amazing, actually.  it seems like a 100 percent success."  The ancient man looked at him through his yellow eyes with skepticism.  Alternating between looking at the Doctor and gazing at a picture of the Boy he held in his hand  "We have been down this road before, Doctor, and it has always led to disappointment."  "But all of the tests...ALL of them have come back positive...and we have followed the process to the letter.  We had never gotten to the death of the Mother before without a break!  and his blood proves it!  He is an exact match!"  "If that is the case, and you are so sure, than I must meet him"  "That has all been arranged.  You will get to meet him in about 6 months, after he has received his rejection notices from the Art schools.  You will be able to watch his training in person from that point on until his military service, you will be his first contact with his destiny"  "I hope you are as good of a geneticist as you claim to be, so that I will have that 6 months and the time to indoctrinate him...No matter how long you can keep us alive, time is running out, We must have success! Herr Doctor."  "Do not fear, Herr Secretary Borrman, we have not failed.  That boy not only looks like, but for all practical intents and purposes, he is, Adolf Hitler!;

xerdopwerko;politics;2015-03-17 15:40:16;The original version of the PRI, after the revolution, was socialist leaning.   After the "Mexican Miracle" of the 1950s, it leaned further and further right. Today, it is the model "Neoliberal" party. One of our former presidents is one of the architects of the IMF's current policies, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo.   The strongest opposition party is the PAN, founded by the Synarchists, which were Pro-Franco, Pro-Mussolini Catholic fascists from the 1930s. While it leaned towards a slightly more liberal "Christian-Democracy" policy, especially with Clouthier in the late 1980s and early 90s, the PAN is a borderline Neofascist Catholic Pro-Business party, with close ties to organised crime. The more conservative wings of PRI and PAN are closely woven together. It is said both parties are run by Carlos Salinas (president of Mexico from 1988-1994, heavily conservative neoliberal), who was actually a member of both of them.  He, in fact, had the candidates of both parties, Clouthier for the PAN and Colosio for the PRI, killed within a few years, so that his successor Zedillo could take power.  Maybe you mean the PRD, which was, as of 2006, infiltrated by lots of PAN followers, called the "Chuchos", led by Jesús Zambrano.   Yes, the PRI still hold membership in the Socialist International, but that was earned by the 20th century PRI, right after the Mexican Revolution (hell, their model of land distribution was originally adopted by the Bolshevik revolutionaries themselves, in the 20s!).  I wish, completely and totally, that we had real Socialism in Mexico.  PRI and PAN, however, are closely in line to Business-side Republicans and Religious-side Republicans, respectively.

mistersunshin;WorldofTanks;2015-03-17 15:49:24;Prepare for quote tower of doom.  &gt I'm going to start off by saying that my problem with the tank isn't when it's top tier. You can do well in almost any tank when you're top tier, even the AMX 40 simply because half the field can't pen the damned thing.  How is the AMX 40 relevant to the conversation? Very few tanks have armor that works against a higher tier than they are. Many don't have enough armor to protect them from low tiers  the BDR does, and that's worth something. The BDR *is*, however, easily the strongest of the tier 5 heavies when bottom tier. Armor is irrelevant and they're all slow, so the only differentiating factor is the gun. It's the only one that has both enough pen and alpha to genuinely threaten tier sevens.   &gt The hull hitbox actually extends out into the tracks, and the tracks themselves only offer minimal protection of that hitbox. If someone fires high or low into the tracks they'll eat the shot but if you're side-scraping they can just shoot into the front of the track and pen with ~100mm of penetration. Also that auto-bounce zone is tiny compared to the rest of the tank, and anyone manually aiming will just aim between the massive turret and the equally massive flat front of the upper hull.  I have never found this to be a serious problem, either on this tank or on the Churchills. You will personally encounter someone who knows this and has the skills and opportunity to take advantage of it *maybe* once every ten games. When you do you simply use your kit on your tracks and change your approach.   That the autobounce zone is roughly a quarter of it's frontal hull and is dead center of mass, at a tier where guns with worse than .4 accuracy are the norm. The LFG is steeply angled enough to be a bounce even dead on. That leaves the strip between the two, and the upper glacis as valid targets, which is half of the hull at most.  &gt No, both in stats and in practice the KV-1 is at worst dead even with the BDR, and at best has better terrain resistance values and a better top speed, even if it loses out marginally in engine power. The deficit in top speed means that the KV-1 starts slowing down later, meaning the deficit in engine power matters less.  Alright, on hard terrain their acceleration is roughly equivalent  one gets 20% better specific horsepower, the other gets 20% better terrain resistance. On medium terrain, where one spends the *vast majority of one's time*, both tanks have the same terrain resistance so the BDR wins out significantly. On soft terrain, which is rare and typically a death sentence to enter, the KV has a small advantage.  All of this is acceleration only.  The KV climbs hills slower, turns and maneuvers slower, and can't hit it's supposed top speed without both favorable terrain and a 15+ second runup. The BDR turns fast enough to keep it's gun on a circling medium, the KV doesn't. Given all that, and having driven both of them within the last day, it is absolutely clear to me that the BDR has better overall mobility than the KV.  &gt Which is a good thing because it doesn't have the accuracy to aim for weak-points, and it has a 10 second reload putting its overall DPS as the lowest of any Tier 5 Heavy tank, even the Premiums.  Considering I can and do aim for and hit weakpoints in it every single time I drive it, I have no idea where that's coming from. Stock reload is 9.1 seconds, not ten, and mine is eight seconds flat with vents and a rammer. DPM is technically the lowest, but the gap isn't very big, and TTK is comparable because of the head start 240 gives you. This is ignoring both overmatch possibilities and the simple advantage that having best-in-tier alpha gives you for trading. It has the best firepower in class/tier by a mile  the tier five tanks that have more are all turretless TDs.  &gt Which beats the hell out of the BDR, whose only useful armor is whatever you can turn into an auto-bounce zone at the time. Also the lower plate is at an auto-bounce angle, so basically the entire front of the hull is good, which is better than the VK, M6, or T-150, though the turret is still lousy.  Which happens to be a significant portion of the tank. The fact that the frontal hull is actually pretty well armored just encourages people to shoot at your paper turret. It also has the same hull-behind-track issue that is apparently a big deal on the BDR. At long ranges the Arl's armor is passable  at close range it's pretty bad and you shouldn't expect much out of it. When a tier 6 heavy has to worry about a derp Hetzer firing AP, it does not get to claim to be well armored.  &gt That top 90mm has the best penetration in tier though, and better penetration that most guns a tier higher, to the point that it barely has to aim at a T-150 to penetrate it from the front. The Accuracy is also equal to the M6 and KV-85 (with the 100mil) even though the soft stats are worse.  Its also easily the worst choice of gun for the tank. It has *excessive* pen in that it trades away every other stat that matters to get it. It has bad dpm and bad functional accuracy because of the appallingly bad handling and aimtime, while only having passable alpha. It takes more time and exposure to put a round on target with this thing than it does with an *IS*. Even a KV-2 is arguably better in this regard because even it has better soft stats and only has to hit the target. All for 240 measly damage. You only pick this gun if you're too poor to ever carry a single prem round. The other guns have their issues, but the DCA45 is a bad gun on this tank.  &gt It ends up with better armor than the Tiger 1, and the same squishy turret half the Heavies at that tier have. The mobility and gun depression are still better than the BDR's, and combined with the fantastic pen and decent accuracy on the gun mean that it can still do something in higher tier matches.  No, it really doesn't. The only usable piece of armor on either of these tanks besides their only-thick-enough-to-not-be-overmatched sides is the Tiger's turret face.  The Tiger can hide it's hull and be *somewhat* safe  the M4 just gets penned. Its pen is, again, the gun's (and the tank's, actually) only virtue. Still got bad bloom stats, still got bad aimtime compared to it's damage, still got last-in-class dpm which is a big deal on this tank, unlike on the BDR, because it's alpha damage is so weak. You will lose a slugging match with an *E25* because of your bad dpm, low hp, and non-existent armor. Its mobility is better than the BDR's, but its not significantly better than that of the M4 45's *peers*. Gun depression is largely wasted because of it's giant paper turret and long exposure times. It will also screw you over in a brawl because it drops to one lousy degree outside of your front 160, on a tall tank no less. Lastly, 132 pen on a tier 5 is every bit as useful as 212 on a tier 7, to say nothing of the proportionally better alpha on the BDR.  &gt Believe it or not I'm not a shit player. I've got a 57% win rate in the thing with 40 battles, I just don't find the tank fun. I even like the VK better than the BDR because for whatever reason it's just not as frustrating to drive, especially when I'm not top tier. I'm happy that you like the tank but I just don't. It's frustrating, it's not fun, and that has nothing to do with how good the gun is and everything to do with how crap everything else about the tank is, especially when it's not top tier.  I don't think you were a shit player. French tanks are... weird, and you're obviously new to them. There's nothing else in the game that plays quite like them, and their strengths and weaknesses are less obvious than other nations (save possibly the Brits) because they're based on the emergent properties of several of the tank's stats in combination  they only become clear by playing them. There's nothing wrong with not *getting* them.  In the case of the BDR you clearly don't understand how to make the tank work if, in your own words, you struggle to do more than two shots of damage a game and think it's bad bottom tier. As an aside, there are two things that can make a tank work bottom tier: mobility and firepower. Heavies in general don't have the former, and the BDR has the latter in spades. It is *easily* the best tier 5 heavy bottom tier, it's not even a contest. You haven't even played the tanks that follow.  My offer stands. Incidentally, I got my first Poole's medal in any tank in the BDR last night in an 11-15 loss (only took me 12k battles, such a scrub). Already had two Radley's in the BDR  I am never selling it.;

Mmmslash;hoggit;2015-03-17 15:52:58;Hi there!  I co-run the ***Wings Wednesdays*** and ***Wings European Wednesdays*** events over at /r/clearbackblast, as well as out Dedicated server (big shoutout to my IL-2 better-half, **Fixie**!) and have been playing BoS for the last six months or so, so I thought I would pitch in my thoughts and impressions so far.  **The Good**: Battle of Stalingrad is the best World War 2 Flight Simulator to date. I love 1946 as much as the next guy, but it's definitely a situation of quantity over quality. I don't need 13 different models of the G.50, especially since I know they don't have actual data on every individual model.  Flying in BoS is a dream. Everything about it just feels good. Banking up into the sky and falling back down on the Soviets in your 109 is incredible. It plays great, feels great, and is just a genuine joy. If you like World War 2 air combat, you owe it to yourself to play this. The flight models and damage models are both pretty much excellent, and there is little more thrilling than watching the rivets in your wing slowly come loose as you desperately try to get on the ground before it finally tears loose. It truly is beautiful.  If you're like me, you're probably more into the cooperative business than the dogfight stuff, and fortunately, five months after launch, that finally exists. It's a little wonky, but the forums are slowly cranking out missions and the editor (if a bit jank) is functional. We're having a really good time, and it's nice to see 12 WWII fighters in the air simultaneously for the first time since the mid 2000's, for me.  Support has also been consistent, with major patches and discussions about them every two to four weeks. They recently announced a standalone expansion (Think Forgotten Battles) focused around the Battle of Moscow. Word was that it was supposed to entire early access this month, but we'll see. You can expect the new map (with multiple season variations  BoS' Stalingrad should see this same treatment in Q3) and 10 new planes. Some are earlier models, most are brand new.  **The Bad**: Single player might as well not exist. You will not be doing your dynamically generated campaigns of yore. You will fly missions that loosely fit each other and strictly fit the war's timeline. The only reason to play this mode is to unlock plane modifications (if you do not own the two Premium planes, which would allow you to unlock all modifications instantly) and skins, and since custom skins are supported, that end of it underwhelming.  Some folks also have some issues with the Fw-190's flight model. Personally, I think they're wrong. Still, even today there was a major patch that was released, tweaking these values (and many others).  Additionally, BoS is a $60 / $100 (USD) product. Whether those two additional planes are worth the extra $40 is up to you. Without them, again, you will need to play the underwhelming single-player experience. Consider that the Battle of Moscow standalone expansion will probably be priced in an identical manner, 8 planes for $60 and 10 for $100.  If you have any specific questions, let me know. I love Stalingrad, but I am ready to accept it's issues. ;
whatdoesthedatasay;AskReddit;2015-03-17 15:54:39;Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.      Women are more easily influenced by social and peer pressure, as evidenced by widespread conformity to standards of beauty and fashion, and enforce that conformity all on their own once it's been communicated to them.      The implementation and growth of the welfare state/social safety net, at least in the US where I'm from, correlates neatly with the introduction of women's suffrage. It's a nice idea, but it has irreparably bankrupted the entire western world. American social spending got its start with the New Deal, and Eleanor Roosevelt's success in getting women voters on board with the new normal of public-sector jobs and government stimulus spending was a major component of ever making that proto-socialist dream a reality. Women created the deficit, is what I'm trying to say.      On foreign policy, far too many women subscribe to the idea that not antagonizing a nation or group will turn them into dear little lambs. The result is the religiously held belief that the more moderate party should always back down in a tense military situation, because obviously the more belligerent party won't, and peace is the end objective. This is a suicidal idea. Not all women believe this, but too many do.      Bowing to female voices on campus speech, sexual harassment, and social justice issues - all areas in which females, in my experience, form a decisive majority of those engaged - has led to a more bitter, unpleasant, and restricted public sphere. Free speech is a thing of the past, you simply cannot say certain things (like "women shouldn't vote") and expect to keep your job, and it's social media and arts/entertainment mobs that are enforcing it, not "traditionally patriarchal" bodies like the government, police, schools, churches, or businesses.      All that said, I understand this makes me an asshole, ladies, and I eagerly await my double term in the coming social justice reconditioning camps. ;

Changing the way I phrase things just means you'll find a new angle to ignore what I said. ;

Sithrak;politics;2015-03-17 15:59:53;To be precise: while I am against non-marginal gun ownership, I think Americans can have their guns if they think it defines them culturally. After all, culture does not need to be rational and it's fine, we all have our idiosyncracies. I also want to focus on the question of guns preventing government from going bad, really, and ignore the issues of crime etc. which are a (huge) different discussion entirely.  &gt While Europe is peaceful now, another war or economic collapse could easily cause a government to choose a minority group to scapegoat.  You think if, say, Muslims in Europe were armed to teeth it was any better for them? I would argue it would only make things worse.  &gt What happened to the Jews when Hitler disarmed them?   Would guns change anything? They had the whole country along with its military turned against them. At this point, they have already lost. It would be more bloody and perhaps more heroic, but guns would not prevent the government from doing what they wanted. If anything, it would have been showcased by the propaganda that Jews are violent and dangerous.  &gt Your racism doesn't make sense in your assumption all white Christians act a certain way.  What racism? It is statistics. I also did not say "all". Simply wondering why so many of the least persecuted majority group feels so threatened by a government ran almost exclusively by white Christians.;

GenBlase;shockwaveporn;2015-03-17 16:03:15;Subhuman is a dangerous way of talking. No way am I saying that they have any sort of superiority, I am saying that they are biologically humans. Humans just like the rest of us, humans that have made poor choices.   Calling something subhuman will never have the desired effect, look at the Nazis, they called Jews subhumans. The KKK called blacks subhuman. The Spanish called the Aztecs subhumans. US government called Natives subhuman.   Even though these people are horrible, disgusting creatures. They are not subhumans, they are humans representing the most dark, impure form of the human mind and soul.   You, telling me that I am, in anyway, supporting these disturbed people is a disappointing way to justify yourself of calling them subhuman. Calling these sad people subhuman does not change the fact that they are humans. The same physiology and brain as any other humans, they represent the most hated parts of ourselves, the most disgusting parts of our minds. Calling them subhuman is an even worse crime, it suggests that we are superior, that we are better than that kind of thing. That is the easiest way to slip and fall, to form another Adolf Hitler, another ISIL, another Charles Manson. ;

Real talk,   Wicked top has pretty much failed to win his lane or carry or play remotely close to the level you expect from a top team. I would bench him.  Shock has great games, and awful games, he is too inconsistent on a team that's built around him getting froggen ahead so he can carry.  Froggen, Farms to much, plays to passive, and i tried remembering when he roamed around and helpped his other lanes in a game. After 10 minutes I gave up. He's a passive farm heavy mid, which isn't meta atm, though with Tank junglers coming back. It could soon be about staling out games again... ur Hurray??  Rekkles. If they hadn't spent so much time hyping him joining, i wouldn't have noticed him on the team at all. He actually does stuff right? Cause another farm heavy player on a team... Yay not good enough this season at all.  Kerpo - just joined, played okay, tried to make plays which they need.  Dexter - Just joined, has a history of camping the shit out of mid and getting them ahead to carry games. Wasn't remotely shocked to see Elements pair him with Froggen. If he's more consistent then Shook Elements will improve.  All in all Elements need is time, a new top laner and for Froggen and Rekkles to learn to play on the front foot. Farming is nice, but going all in and getting ahead with a double kill, its simply better.  ... Or  They could scape into Summer, higher an unbanned Incarnation move Froggen top. This however is just crazy talk. ;

Cyridius;socialism;2015-03-17 16:13:29;You're not going to get a single correct answer to this question.  My response would be that the conditions in the USSR at the time were not conducive to a proper Proletarian Dictatorship. Production was a fraction of its pre-war level, the working class was destroyed by war, the Communist Party was depleted. This led to greater use of the old Tsarist bureaucracy as a crutch for management of the state.  Ultimately, this all took its toll on the state and the Party took actions under pressure from the rich peasant population, like Lenin's New Economic Policy, which was a step back on the road to Socialism.   Being faced with the contradictions of needing to organise a Socialist form of social organisation, and needing to appease the peasant classes eg. Kulaks, Party members like Stalin rose to the top of the Party with the support of the peasantry, due to his policies(eg. supporting NEP, anti-collectivism etc.)  Eventually, the state's failure started to become imminent and the Party's response to that was to restrict democratic institutions and enact more aggressive policies against the peasantry. This was never really undone and you had a merging of the state bureaucracy and the Party, and a stagnation of the progress towards Socialism and a gradual degeneration of the revolution, ultimately leading to a restoration of Capitalism. ;

dubsteping;worldnews;2015-03-17 16:19:44;ok lets play this game.  &gt How is Russia's behavior doing anything to help or solve any problems? How will it possibly affect the status quo in any way other than getting people killed? "No one can blame them" for threatening the entire world on behalf of nationalistic pride? I sure as hell can.  National security is important, there is nothing they can do to alleviate US attacks except fight back, the alternative is to accept US dominance and bend the knee, Russia culturally and traditionally does not do that, no one dominates Russians, not since mongol times. They are not left with any options, its either do what you are told or we continue our attacks, the US has left no room for compromise, its either you let us win or we keep hitting you over the head. Russia is choosing to fight, under this ultimatum, same way they did with hitler and napoleon. This has saved them in the past, perhaps it will save them now, the Washington war hawks are evil, greedy and they are cowards, they will have to back down or Russia will unleash such terrible vengeance that generations yet unborn will cry out in anguish (that was for comedic effect)   The country simply has no choice, let the bullies beat you down or rise up and fight, perhaps then the bullies will leave you alone. simple school yard tactics, we are all kids anyway and then we die.   &gt The baltics and poland have had "salt poured in their eyes" by Russia for a long time, but for some reason this didn't give them the right to go to NATO for protection in your world of double standards.  Russia does not do these things anymore, they had good reason to go into Georgia (Georgia attacked Russian peace keepers) Ossetia and Ukraine (what did the US do with a similar situation in cuba? what will it likely do if Russia regime changed Canada or mexico? try to think objectively)    Russia doesn't bother nations (they have a noninterventionist policy, while the US has the exact opposite), at least not as much as the USSR, but remember, when the USSR did bad things it was not controlled by Russians, but by Georgia, stalin was Georgian not Russian its like blaming spain alone for the sins of the EU.  or blaming Kansas for something done by the people of Washington. The USSR was a huge place encompassing many nations and they were not always leaders of this Union of republics, why are they then to blame for its sins? especially when the leadership during bad times was held by someone from one of these republics and it was not Russia.   &gt When was the last time a multipolar world brought an era with less conflict than a hegemonic world? Certainly not during the lifetime of anyone currently living. Multiple poles of power didn't do anything to "check" or "balance" the cold war. Or World War 2. Or World War 1.  Look you can say all these things because you won the birth lottery and are living in a nice place, what of all the millions who have died or are suffering because of US hegemony? You live in paradise while the rest of the worlds population (the majority) live under the US hefty boot, while it deems who can live and who should die for its whims and fancy.   This tyranny and abuse of power and position, is now leading to WW3, just because those that they have consistently stompped on are fucking tired of it and are looking to revolt. Look at the disgusting groups that have risen precisely as a result of US policies, look at people having their heads cut of and eyes gorged out. Its a fucking nightmare to be frank.   &gt You are clearly missing the irony that Russia's push to challenge a unipolar world is bring the world closer to war  As I said above the conditions of this unipolar world are leading people to rise up, no one wants to be constantly bullied, no one likes it, and least of all the Russians, they are just more educated organized and culturally stable to rise up and say NO! no more, while the rest resort to animalistic and evil terrorism. China is in the same boat as the Russians, india as well, latin America etc. The only one seating at the podium decreeing this and that and deciding how people live and who dies is the US and its handful of rich minions. A corrupt force trying to rule over the world through deceit, force and trickery.    &gt I'm no supporter of the US or their actions, but that doesn't mean I'm going to support cutting the nose to spite the face and fuck up the whole world just to take the US down a peg. That's kindergarten tactics.  You are right, you and I don't support the US government, but I love the American people, and I would not support cutting off the nose to spite the stupid proverbial face, but I call a spade a spade, people are fed up, wishful thinking will not quiet them down, change is what is needed, change that Obama promised and thereby excited the world, and gave people hope, he has failed or has lied to us all. OR his handlers, the greedy corps that run America, have forced him, he perhaps doesn't want to die, just like Bobby kennedy. Perhaps that's what has kept them in power and US presidents seemingly evil, the fear that those guys will blow their brains out all over the street using their own SS or so.   This tyranny is reaching a boiling point, and will boil over soon enough, the status quo cannot realistically continue for long, we will all die (weapons have gotten too terrible these days) if they don't back down, if they don't relinquish their grip on states and try to form a more equitable world, if not Russia then someone else, its just a matter of time.     So lets not just blindly blame the Russians,  lets blame the real culprits, the people making everyone go crazy with their oppression, no one likes or wants to be a slave, people sooner or later rise up, that's human nature, same as the French revolution, soon enough the downtrodden masses will have had enough and someone will cart-in the guillotine. Its inescapable, if not Russia then someone else, but presently Russia is the only country strong enough to resist, when shit starts flying all the disenfranchised and abused will flock to them, but the battle may not leave anything left... That is the great fear, but what other choice does the world have? perhaps if the US was willing to negotiate rather than place ultimatums, we can all live happily ever after... but I shudder to think what will happen if the US hardlines and tries to call the Russians bluff... I know Russians they don't fucking bluff, when they had it, they have had it and they wouldn't give a fuck, they have a saying ingrained into them, its better to die than live on your knees. That's the attitude that has saved them for centuries.   ;

That's why we just need to show them that we aren't advocating Stalin's communism. We're talking about helping the working man, making sure everyone is represented in the government. We can help people understand this through logic and rationality, not violence. Going a violent route will guarantee two things: we will lose, and we will lose our chance to change things.

NovaNardis;offbeat;2015-03-17 16:24:53;I live in the same neighborhood I grew up in (moved back for law school).  I have mixed feelings about red light cams.  We have a good number on Roosevelt Boulevard, a twelve lane thruway that runs through largely residential areas of Philadelphia.  (Four physically divided segments of three lanes each, two in either direction.)  Two of the intersections near me (Red Lion and Grant Avenues) with the Boulevard were routinely rated among the Top 10 most dangerous in the US.  They've since been cammed, and speeding and running red lights has really plummeted.  Which is great.  On the other hand, a couple years ago a girl got in a drunk driving accident around the corner from me.  She hit a light post and her two passengers were killed.  The nearby light was subsequently replaced and in the name of safety a cam was put in.  The accident had nothing whatever to do with the light, and now the yellow light is remarkably shorter. That's clearly a revenue generating camera.  So, they can be used well.  That doesn't mean they always are.;

TheVitaminAvenger;politics;2015-03-17 16:32:30;&gt You think if, say, Muslims in Europe were armed to teeth it was any better for them? I would argue it would only make things worse.  Better economically?  No.  But what it would do is prevent the government from sending in people to mass detain, impose curfews or do anything else to diminish their rights.  I am also talking about the US given how firearms are a god given right.  &gt Would guns change anything? They had the whole country along with its military turned against them. At this point, they have already lost. It would be more bloody and perhaps more heroic, but guns would not prevent the government from doing what they wanted. If anything, it would have been showcased by the propaganda that Jews are violent and dangerous.  Of course guns would have changed it, why do you think Hitler disarmed them?  It would turned out better for them without a doubt.  In order to suppress a group of people you can't simply destroy everything, you need the infrastructure for after.  It takes boots on the ground which is why guns are invaluable.    As for them being killed anyways, look at the insurgents in Iraq, they have the entire might of the US military raining down on them and nearly a decade and a half later they're still fighting.  The insurgents from the first desert war were often times not armed with anything but bolt action rifles and still were able to fight back quite sucessfully.

Moofaa;itmejp;2015-03-17 16:33:01;This is the worst show I have ever seen and the GM is crap. It's up there with things like Stalin and green beans as the worst things to ever have existed.  Just kidding. It's actually excellent and the Steven is amazing along with the large cast of players.  I haven't had a chance to watch episode 10 (youtube viewer and I have no internet at home because 'murica").   So heres my answers to your questions, for what little my opinion matters   1. The format of a rotating cast of players keeps the show fresh (+9). Whatever selection process you have for choosing players is working well (+8). It takes a while to get some groups together to continue their storylines (-4). And sometimes its a little annoying when groups get bogged down with random encounters and never get to do what they originally started (-3). Those negatives are mostly just a result of the format however, nothing is perfect.  2. It's interesting how much mileage you can get story-wise out of a handful of low-level characters just by throwing in some randomness and good role-playing. You don't need to be a 20th level whatever just to be cool or even a local hero (Kurthak is becoming well-known for instance).  Now for GM advice   1. Nothing really to add. You do a fine job overall.   2. Just keep running things the way you are. Most of the players you've had on the show have done really well with making their own stories. My only word of caution here is that things could get TOO complicated if characters start mixing between groups a little too often. Luckily JP is using new characters in many sessions. Some cross-over is welcome, but its something that could spiral out of control.  3. Much like #2, if you keep having great players and letting randomness and player  interaction drive the story you will end up with all sorts of cool developments. ;

Jux_;todayilearned;2015-03-17 16:36:25;You can always lead back to money.   War for land? Land and expansion is valuable.   Civil War? The southern states didn't like being told they couldn't expand slavery, because that was profitable. And the North sure didn't want to lose the revenue associated with the union splitting.   World War I? We initially wanted to be neutral, but we started growing the Navy. Just in case. And the Germans put the kibosh on international shipping lanes. We were okay with them sinking the Lucitania in violation of international law but we sure as heck weren't OK with our shipping being targeted.   World War II? Roosevelt was selling arms to the allies before Pearl Harbor, "keeping peace" by supplying weapons to those involved and provoking Germans along the way.   Vietnam? Communism threatens our capitalistic ways!  And then we got super smart, and created a war against *terrorism* - this vague enemy that you can't really define, or see, or even know when you've won. It's fucking brilliant, now we can always find a reason to ramp up the military industrial complex.   If we ever went to war for moral reasons, we wouldn't be standing for the shit North Korea is doing to it's people. What they're doing is arguably worse than the Holocaust, or at least on pace for it. But there's not enough money to justify risking a loss to China and Russia. ;

Windex007;worldnews;2015-03-17 16:47:22;I can easily imagine it. How did Stalin handle dissent in his country? Those who drew images he felt undermined his authority? How on Earth was this violence and suppression possible without being religious in nature?  And you're right, Race and gender aren't even in the same ballpark as religion. Racial based conflict and death historically dwarf religious based conflict.  One of us is grasping at straws.  You seem to think that a human construct has reversed it's role as a product of human thought and become the dictator of human thought, robbing humans of their agency. How convenient it is that wars fought in the name of religion are so perfectly aligned with the will of those in power at the time. How incredibly coincidental that what those in positions of political power want can be obtained by doing morally problematic things that just so happen to be found to be acceptable by twisting a religion to suit their agenda. How *incredibly* lucky for them.  One of us is being very naive.;

hai-faiv;socialism;2015-03-17 16:54:53;Stalin and Stalinist rulers distorted communism/socialism ideologically. Also, many of these regimes were propped up by the USSR under Stalin, and some rulers were even directly hand-picked by Stalin, such as Kim Il-sung.  Instead of a genuine socialist society, organized democratically, Stalinism's ideal society was a totalitarian bureaucratic state-capitalist dictatorship. Instead of progressing society forward socially, these regimes often promoted social conservatism, nationalism, and xenophobia.   The regimes that we saw, are a result of that distortion. So their connection to socialism, or even to the left at all, is very tenuous. Due to the Stalinization of the international communist movement, anyone advocating for a democratic socialist society was sidelined, politically repressed or brutally repressed. One such tragic example of the latter is Ta Thu Thau, Vietnamese Trotskyist leader.  ;
TKInstinct;todayilearned;2015-03-17 16:55:03;Rommel was part of a conspiracy, of which the ultimate goal was to kill Hitler. Hitler did eventually find out but, because Rommel was such a highly decorated figure in the Military and was such a figurehead to the public he was given a option on how he would ultimately be recorded as dying. He could a.) Choose to commit suicide, which he did choose. He was driven out to where no one was around and left in a car, where he swallowed a cyanide pill.  He did this for several reasons, the biggest being that if he chose to go through a public battle he would be dragged through a muck and his image tarnished. His family would have also been dragged through the muck and, would ultimately face execution. Finally, according to Wikipedia, his Army staff would have been executed.  Hitler was known to employ what was known as "Kangaroo Courts" which were courts that appeared to be official courts without bias. However, in reality they leaned towards the prosecution and there would have been no way for him to be acquitted.   He would have also been kicked out of the Army, dishonorably and stripped of all of his accomplishments for the Reich up until that point.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Death;

Most of what fiscal responsibility comes down to was invented shortly after Goldwater and the rest of his crazy ass chickenhawks took up the libertarianism mantle to distance themselves from the Rockefellers in the party. The Republican party began to tread slowly away from racist appeal and changed their tune to economic prosperity through destroying the welfare state. The birth of the welfare queen (which is commonly attributed to a non-white person, despite the example given by Reagan being a white woman) along with the notion that the welfare state being some sort of economic restriction toward white male economic mobility. While it's more difficult to refute that point, there's very little evidence that economic prosperity and a well funded welfare state can't go hand-in-hand.  &gt Small government is not the same as no government.  Small government is just shifting governance from one form to another. Instead of an elected President being the figurehead of a government, it would just be the CEO of Standard Oil or a consortium of mining company CEOs dictating things. The US has a pretty established past of a form of government popping up  just like nature abhorring a vacuum, society abhors a power vacuum. Pinkertons and others formed the for-hire army, and they were plenty fine with killing Americans if their price was met. Roads, dams and other projects were created, too, but only for the wealthy and if you were hurt by them who cares, you didn't have enough money to matter.  Libertarianism, again, is failed political philosophy. Every time the same horse shit pops up in America and every time it's at the tail end of economic malaise. It's similar to Stalinism in that it throws out some bullshit that people eat up because it sounds great but in the end, it concentrates power in the hands of the unelected few.;

You said they are legally adults, and so they have that right to vote - also true - but their legal status doesn't give them any more merit, especially since the brain doesn't enter a mature stage until 25-30, and college students are only just *beginning* to become educated.

Eh, he'll just let it slide. You chuck a fancy Santa at your poster of Benedict Arnold. You like using that one as one of your many opponents.  Theo: Examine Posters. You briefly revel in the glory of democratic leaders of many years past. These great men have lead a country to an interuniversal nation, uniting many creatures across multiple universes. You pay special regard to your namesake, Theodore Roosevelt. That glorious son of a bear (or so you like to think to yourself) caused all this glorious unity of Trolls and Humans. He is an inspiration to us all. Theo: Exit room and speak with guardian. You exit said room and have a brief chat with your father about the ways of politics.

He was also a distinguished soldier and leader during WWI.  He was even considered a political candidate during the 1940's elections.    However, during the push back against the North Korean invasion, MacArthur went against express orders in several respects and invaded the North, thus instigating Chinese involvement.   Truman removed MacArthur from command in Korea thus receiving a huge political backlash of public support for the decision. He decided not to even run for reelection.   Casey, Steven (2008).

gameronice;worldnews;2015-03-17 17:19:10;Yeah, you have little grasp of the whole picture, no knowledge of engineering, real-estate and limited points of reference. Pretty standard cherry picking as they like to imagine it these days. But once you dive deeper, into history and technical data, which I did back in the university, talking to people who lived from 30 till now, form a big picture, it's not even close to how you describe it.   Once again, I know a lot about how stuff was build and made in Latvia, it largely contradicts most of what you say. Same can be told about many other places. 1950s and early 60s were very rough, but clearly you never looked at statistics and compared them. There are eras in soviet construction, each had own ideas and tendencies, starting with stalin-era massive buildings that were on par to pre-war city housing (even now it's very prestegios to live in these houses), to mass constructed panel and brick buildings, some bad some real good even by western standards. Try and do some real estate comparing fro Talin, pre-war, during soviet rule, and after it. Compare population growth and many other things.   People give USSR a lot of bad rep, some of it rightfully deserves, specially the bloody Stalin times, but after that it's like people ignore anything else, all the grand projects and designs that people take for granted even now, and take take to compare to 30 years later, after 10 years of poverty and little support of the infrastructure. Like Stalin ruled from 30 way to 1992. No big picture, Sheesh.;

aleksey2;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 17:22:06;To clarify, Ukraine and Belarus didn't get annexed after WW2, but were enlarged in size by seizing land from "liberated" countries (in quotes, cause while they did get liberated from the Nazis, it was held against them as though they had a bill to pay to the USSR for the aforementioned liberation). If I understand correctly, you're asking why the USSR didn't annex Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria and instead allowed them to remain independent states on paper. All the while, in practice, actually fully controlling what those countries got to do via their respective Socialist governments, who were puppets of the Kremlin? If that *is* your question, then there could be many explanations as to why, none of which are good enough to explain everything on their own. Having said that, I think two really good reasons as to why are 1) deniability and 2) creating a buffer zone.  **Deniability** - the best of both worlds, if your worlds consist solely of 'wanting to exert control' and 'not wanting to pay anything for it'. USSR was all like, "Who me? Naah, bruh, I don't control those countries. They are *totally* independent, have their own *elected* governments and do as they please".   When you annex a territory, you gotta deliver a benefit for the people you're annexing. Romans solved it by giving the conquered Roman citizenship and creating some peace and prosperity (albeit that changed depending on the era of Roman Republic/Empire). In return Romans got to extract/take what they wanted and needed from the new province. It hasn't really changed much - you gotta give the people you're conquering something in return for their freedom. And that's a costly endeavour  something that a war-torn country might not be willing to consider. Instead, if what you really want is to control the population AND you can get that control by getting the governments of those countries to do your bidding for you (and to coöperate fully with your requests), then you've just achieved control without exerting any serious costs. Now you get what you want and you have to provide **none** of the services and benefits you would have had to if you annexed that same territory.  Btw, this all assumes that the territory in question isn't full of oil or any other natural resources. Cause in those cases, "empires" will still want to annex it any *any* cost.   **Buffer zone.** It wasn't exactly clear that a new conflict wasn't going to start after Berlin fell. The West never truly trusted the USSR and vice versa even while they shared the common enemy. With the new enemy soon-to-be gone (or now gone, if we're talking about post-may-1945), it wasn't assumed that peace will reign in. The USSR was prepared for a new conflict, if it would arise, and the bigger the buffer zone between the West and Moscow, the better. Now, if you can control and coordinate with Polish/Romanian/Bulgarian governments and military without having to spend any money on their citizens, then you've achieve your objective. Now you can have a new war and hope that it stays contained within the countries on the periphery of USSR. You get two outcomes from this. Either USSR wins or it loses. In both cases you, the USSR, hope that the conflict takes place and *stays* in those countries. That way if you have to surrender and pull out, you haven't actually lost any territory that's your own. If it's a costly stalemate or if you win by way of 'scorched earth/leave no building standing' tactic of military attack, then you just make Poland/Romania/Bulgaria weaker in the process. Now whether you win or lose, they will be too poor and bombed out to either be a threat or to stand on their own. If they stay allied to Moscow, they'll be even weaker to resists Kremlin's influence. If they flip sides and join the West, then the logic is that it would be so costly to rebuild them and that the West would never want to spend the money to do so.  Fundamentally, the decisions of WW2 USSR and post-WW2 USSR were made by Stalin, a certified lunatic and a deranged psychopath who viewed the world as a constant "us vs. them" struggle and regarded all human lives with outmost of disregards (obligatory link to what happened to Stalin's own [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Dzhugashvili#Second_World_War)).;

Stauffenberg even attempted to assassinate Hitler in [Operation Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Valkyrie) and was nearly successful. He was executed as a traitor for his role so, while he was *technically* a Nazi because he was in the German military when the Nazis took over he obviously didn't have a great liking for them and was a central figure in the [German Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Resistance_to_Nazism) within the Wehrmact (i.e., the German military).

We are all staying directly on Bay/River St so getting downstairs and  back up wont be an issue. Then the plan is to pick a road and walk till we hit the cathedral, taking pics along the way. Then jump in a car and go from the cathedral to the island.   I went to school at SVA, so did our photographer, so we have no only made that walk hundreds of times but we also kinda have a rough idea of where those "pictures along the way" should be.   I rambled. Im sorry. Savannah natives make me excited. Its nice for someone to have an idea of what im talking about. ;
lightsaberon;worldnews;2015-03-17 17:38:39;&gt How did Stalin handle dissent in his country? Those who drew images he felt undermined his authority? How on Earth was this violence and suppression possible without being religious in nature?  I didn't say religion was the only way of inducing mass violence, but it is certainly the easiest and most effective.  Also, there's a huge difference between one man protecting his dominance and power and an entire society freely subjecting a cartoonist to violence.  Notice how today rates of racial and gender violence are much, much lower than ever before, yet religion sees continual peaks in war, atrocities and mass violence.  &gt And you're right, Race and gender aren't even in the same ballpark as religion. Racial based conflict and death historically dwarf religious based conflict.  What a load of bullshit.  Where are the gender based atrocities?  Were women purged because of their gender?  What desperate nonsense.  There were racial conflicts in history, but what about now?  Religious wars and atrocities are a **daily** occurrence in 2015!!  Where are all those racial and gender equivalents?  In your imagination?  &gt You seem to think that a human construct has reversed it's role as a product of human thought and become the dictator of human thought, robbing humans of their agency.  This is some absurd nonsense.  Religion is as much a part of "human thought" as it is a "human construct".  As are all manner of other things.  Human agency is simply our capacity to act, to do something.  No one's speaking of robbing human's of their ability to do things.    &gt How convenient it is that wars fought in the name of religion are so perfectly aligned with the will of those in power at the time. How incredibly coincidental that what those in positions of political power want can be obtained by doing morally problematic things that just so happen to be found to be acceptable by twisting a religion to suit their agenda. How incredibly lucky for them.  Oh so it's all about an ulterior motive?  So, tell me what exactly is the ulterior motive behind entire societies (not individuals) freely supporting violence against people who draw cartoons insulting a religious figure?  Do they stand to gain money, power, fame?  &gt One of us is being very naive.  I definitely agree there.  ;

We know he came from a "boys from brazil" type situation.    Malory took him, from a scientist, that was working on cloning.  That is basically a fact.    So the question is:   What would a Nazi Scientist be more likely to try and clone?   Hitler?  or  Some random asshole?  or  Himself?

RallyUp;television;2015-03-17 17:41:48;Hang on though, the Nazi's really were trying to take over all of Europe and eradicate as many of what they called 'sub human' minorities off the earth as they could. A shitload of that was complacency with country and kin, just like the U.S. and it's militarized youth are seeing today. But at the end of the day if the world hadn't stomped that shit out, they may well have overwhelmed the British before Japan forced America into the war. That really was a war. It was conquest on the part of the Germans, and the reason they let old Adolf become such a force had a lot to do with the perceived wrongs against the German people by the rest of the world, but France in particular. They always had it out for the French. They wanted to wait the British and the Soviet Russians out but he ended up scaring Stalin with his (Hitler) heavy handed tactics and overall blitzkrieg approach.    But I digress. They were truly an evil force of hatred that had to be destroyed. I agree with you on the other points but when it comes to legitimate Nazi's I have to draw a line. Even today, knowing what I know and the revelations of modern shit like Internet and social networking, I would still join the fight against Nazism if it grew to the point it was in the 30's and 40's. That shit was for the most part, just pure evil. Geo politically based evil. But pure fucking evil.;

Hitler secures Russian industry and the Caucuses oil and pushes on to Britain. Germany is now under Hitler's control.  Although one thing I find fascinating is that if you go back to the beginning of time and change just one of the constants of physics very slightly, the whole universe would be unrecognisable, it would be governed by subtly different laws of physics and unimaginably different in its make up, not necessarily stars and rocks as we know it today.;

qounqer;politics;2015-03-17 17:46:12;Yes, i think that pretty new-stations have there own particular bias, like Piers Morgan on CNN spewing shit into some poor souls ears, but Fox is the precedent for American political propaganda. Not a single liberal, and very few rational conservatives have a place on that network, and all of them seem to have the same convenient talking points. Many people buy into the idea of the "liberal media" which has the effect of making people unwilling to look at sources without an inherent conservative bias because they view that as the true propaganda. This in turn just reinforces their beliefs until you have poor people believing in flat taxes, trickle-down ecenomics, and the Christ like nature of Ronald Reagan, they then wrap this pile of self serving shit in the shiny veneer of "it will help the middle class just like it did in the 80's, does everyone remember how great the 80's where? Because they where great.".  It's genius in the same way as hitler managing to get in power by just blaming everything on the jews while simultaneously stroking the egos of the Germans. ;

Xizithei;shockwaveporn;2015-03-17 17:47:42;HA! Nice straw-man, man! That's pretty good. You almost had me thinking you weren't some disingenuous recent college graduate.   President Obama: War criminal, definitely, subhuman? That depends on whether he is actively aiming to cause harm to innocent people. Though, his drone policy indicates that may well be accurate, as well as for Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al.  My Mother: She's moral, she has never murdered, she doesn't seek to destroy history. I'd say she's pretty human, and humane.  My ex's? No, as above, they've never murdered anyone, at least that I know of.   What is good and true? That's honestly easy. Don't kill, don't commit theft, do not oppress, do not invade, do not blow up wedding parties to target a SUSPECTED terrorist. Do not wage wars for financial gain, or any reason other than the defense of yourself and your loved ones.   Are you saying being a murderer or rapist IS something to be proud of? I say those are the things to abhor, to dehumanize.   Like I said, I don't murder, steal, or cheat. I provide goods for those who cannot afford it, give food and money to the destitute. I extol the open desire for all to have open and equal rights in life. The right to live without being oppressed, by governments or religions. I demand the right for people who love each other to marry, regardless of gender, or race, or beliefs.   "So many people" like whom? Who all has said the above, verbatum, and meant it? "For the good of the nation" is not the above concept, by the way, before you include Mao, Hitler, or Stalin. ;
Hermann_Von_Salza;european;2015-03-17 17:49:02;There are also trends in academia against nationalism, which filter out to the public.  Benedict Anderson's *Imagined Communities* was a particularly influential work.  Predictably, it portrays nationalism as a social construct.  The logical conclusion is that internationalism, or "continentalism" of the EU variety, is the solution, ignoring that these are also social constructs.  These same people often decry multinational corporations, the IMF, the World Bank, and corporate inversions, but fully support international law.  Financial support from historically internationalist groups, known as "rootless cosmopolitans", historically threatened by nationalist groups and moving from country to country, is never discussed.  I wouldn't quite put it on the Soviet Union.  The mid-1920's Soviet struggles between the Left Opposition, led by Trotsky and initially supported by Lev Kamenev and Grigorii Zinoviev, lost the struggle, as did the NEP right opposition of Nikolai Bukharin.  Stalinism is highly centered around "Socialism in one country," as the Piedmont Strategy failed and Stalin became more distrustful of the borderlands and exporting socialism.  He eventually dissolved Comintern in 1943.;

All he did was engineer international relations to create excuses to invade sovereign nations, one after another. And he talked of Eastern Europe like a Manifest Destiny that made Americans genocide Native Americans and claim all their land for settlers and immigration. A world where no one stopped Hitler, I and many people I know would've never been born, cuz our living ancestors were on the precipice of ethnic destruction. How can people judge the preponderance of text, Hitler and his inner circles orders, manifestos, speeches, policies, and actions then say they didn't want to kill every Slavic Jewish Romanian etc undesirable people and resettle the land for the glory of a German Empire? That's the Third Reich, the crux of Nazism, the entire point of everything! And the Holocaust is the memory of all those innocents who were victims of it, and should be seen as more than Zionist bullshit like Israeli nutjobs spin it as. Many Holocausts have happened in history, only that was one in living memory and it is very important to learn lessons from the survivors who just want it to never happen again. ISIS for example could be the next Third Reich with their caliphate being exactly the same concept. ;

mattmast89;GetMotivated;2015-03-17 17:54:07;You are seriously a fucking idiot. You cannot separate the fact that defending historical truth is different than being a diehard apologetical fan of the Catholic Church. Someone gave historical fact and you refuse to de  &gt I'm not giving you a reference for the systematic rape of native children either. Still happened.  Wow, fucking stupidity once again from you. All you are spouting is bullshit without any proof. This argument isn't about the systematic rape of native children (though I am interested if there is any proof about that too). I shouldn't be pulling teeth here for a fact that you kinda claim to be commonly known. You remind me of some people that I had the misfortune to work with that would start an argument, I would ask for proof, then somehow jump to a completely different argument. They also would have terrible logic and know nothing factual. And, they would always jump in with more out of this world facts (like your native children fact and castrati) when they know they are losing with what they started on.  Ultimately, you wanted to deny historical fact because of a "fact" that you are currently unable to prove (maybe because you learned it was a lie but refuse to say you were wrong).   How about we use a different example that relates to this situation(please don't fixate on the story itself tho and start another completely different argument about it, because I notice you like to go down rabbit trails. Yes, it may be a bad example, but work with me here).   Say someone posts that Hitler liked to scoop people's eyeball out and use them as an ice cream topping. Another person comes and replies that this story is entirely false. Then you come and say "Well, I won't give him the benefit of the doubt because he like to dress up as Darth Vader and choke babies [citation needed]. I would then come in and say, first: "Where is the proof he did dressed up as Darth Vader and choked babies?". Second: "It's ridiculous to deny something historical just because you have another (false) story about what terrible things he did". I wouldn't be defending Hitler and I definitely wouldn't say he never did evil things. I'm just questioning your proof on a "fact" you mentioned and questioning your terrible logic. Then, you would reply mentioning "Well, just look up the Holocaust!!!!! See???? I'm right!" (which wouldn't be related to what the real discussion is about)  So, in conclusion, I am not sticking up for the Church here. I am merely saying you have no knowledge of logic and are using lies, not historical truths, to defend yourself. An argument can be both factual and logical, just logical, just factual, or neither. You initial post here was neither logical nor factual. That is why I replied to you. I am not arguing about the other things the Church did, so leave the native children, castrati, and anything else out of this argument. They only detract from your terrible logic and lack of facts from your first post here. So, you could say, I wasn't defending the Church, just attacking your stupid line of thinking. It just so happened I saw this line of thinking in a discussion about the Church. And, yes, if I see another person who makes stupid logical leaps and spits out historical falsehoods, I will address them as well (provided I'm not busy with something else).  Hopefully you finally understand and not drag in so many other stories and "facts" that I do not care to argue about because I am not here to defend/explain every action the Church does. Leave that to the priests and other Catholic academics/writers. ;

He surrounds himself with corrupt people and fill their and his own pockets while doing it. In Russia it's all about who you know and what they can do to for you. It runs through the whole society and anyone who's got experience with Russia will confirm this for you.  He doesn't care about Russia, he only cares about himself and his legacy. He's building his own little empire or dirt and that's where his interests end.  &gt We would be blessed to have such a great leader anywhere in Europe.  He's basically the corrupt EU leaders boiled into one person. Seriously I from the bottom of my heart wish you'd look more into this fucker that is Putin.  &gt I see many parallels with A.H.  The only parallel there is, is that they both speak about doing what's best for their people. Difference is that Hitler actually cared about his people. Putin doesn't.  &gt I agree with Le Pen and German Nationalists that we should have a strong economical Partnership with Russia  The only thing Russia can offer us is natural resource. They don't have any real industry and their economy is completely at the mercy of those natural resources and without shame they'll use that to secure their interests. Look at continental Europe. You guys are completely fucked as you're dependent on Russian gas. We learned our lesson up here and we have heating and power even if Russia cut the gas supply. We only use gas for 10 % of our energy production of which all comes from Russia. But all our plants are equipped so that they can switch fuel within 24 hrs.  Putting ones fate in the hands of Russia in any shape or form is extremely dangerous and fool-hearted. Instead we should focus on growing our internal European market of more than 500 million people. We should invest heavily on research and science so that we are even less dependent on natural gas and oil. This also has great strategic value.  Russia is and will forever be an untrustworthy partner for Europe. History has shown us that since the inception of Russia. And if we cannot learn from hundreds of years of history we as Europeans don't deserve to exist.;

I guess I'd have to correct peoples grammar on the internet to enjoy my superior intellect while I still had it. Would be cool to set up a charity live streaming channel with cameras around my house. I'd probably start by gluing money to objects in my house. Set some other amusing traps for myself. Finally I'd draw simple pictures on the walls reminding me how to do simple things like eat. Hire a butler and hope he stays with me out of pity. 13. I don't think I'd enjoy suffocating in space. Definitely Europe unless I've already had my brain surgery in which case I'll probably forget how to breathe anyway. I could be the first unintelligent form of intelligent life up there. Would be nice to be remembered as the mystery man found dribbling and floating around on the big space rock. 14. I'd cover them in cushions and then kick away. Maybe run into a wall, play dead and then deny anything had happened. 15. I don't think I'd enjoy watching either. If I was artistically shown as awesome I'm down for that. Would be a great way to meet people. Hi I'm the subject of that film you loved. I wouldn't really like a documentary of my life existing. All my secrets would disappear. Lots of awkward conversations would follow but I guess less people I know would find it.;

Awkward_moments;todayilearned;2015-03-17 18:06:34;My history isnt the best but I dont see anything about WWII showing the Nazi's to be cowards. Germany had just come out of "The Great War", "The War to End All Wars" and they had fared by far the worst because of it. It was such a big war people thought it was literally the end of war because no one could possibly want to start another war, and this was from a time when countries had been in a different war every generation. The Nazi then fought against countries that owned most of the world. Just look at this map:  http://balagan.info/wp-content/images/war/world-maps/1938_map_colonisation.png  How you can be fighting France and the UK in Africa, fighting wars in Europe with the commonwealth bringing in men from another 3 continents and US supplying everything, then also decide you want to take on the USSR as well. I dont think the Nazis gave up easy either, they fought till the end.  The Nazi did a lot of shit, but they were not cowards. I don't understand all the crap they did and people make up stuff. Hitler was a great public speaker, one of the best of all time but you mention that and people hate you, I really honestly want to understand why.;

Wikiwakagiligala;europe;2015-03-17 18:15:48;Eh? I hope your not saying they are right... This isn't male culture, it is human culture. Look at any animal, the leader is the strong &amp  confidant one, because that is how power works, we give power to the people that we think will use it to defend our interests.   This is also how old leaders (kings) got their positions, they fought for it, which why so many leaders today have been in the military (tradition). Which, like social upbringing among other things, has made men more popular leaders, because when you can choose between 5 men &amp  5 women then you want the huge deep-voiced bear holding a sword.   What machismo means (from my experience) is not the same as what is going on here. He isn't flexing his muscles and talking about how much of a man he is. He is engaging in politics, which means making deals, threatening enemies, seeking out interests, ect.   Having a world where everybody could help each other with peace and love would be great, but the idea that men are to blame for conflict is stupid &amp  sexist. Men are given the role of fighting the conflict out, but that would be like blaming women for supporting Hitler because they didn't fight against him. If you go to Russia its not about men wanting Putin to do these things, it is men &amp  women in Russia who support Putin because they think he is standing up for them.  Despite people's stereotypes of men, women are just as likely to be aggressive, [for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eX-t6laaf8).;

paredown;geopolitics;2015-03-17 18:24:08;The Tibet/Xinjiang implications of the Chinese taking a hard stance over Crimea or especially the Donbas would be interesting. It's sort of a catch-22--they can't side with the West without seeming to take a stance against imperialism (which would delegitimize their control over historic Tibetan and Uyghur lands), and they can't side with Putin without accepting his narrative that he whole ordeal was the result of legitimate native uprisings in the Ukraine (which recognizing the right of national determination would also undermine their Tibetan/Xinjiang holdings, though I guess in the event of serious separatist action in these areas their decades of Han settlement could pay off by allowing them to move in to "protect ethnic Han", which come to think of it is basically the flipside of what Stalin did the Crimean Tatars).  Of course this is purely academic as far as I can see--China has no compelling reason to make a stand either way.;

JFVarlet;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 18:35:45;Well, it did very much come out of the military as opposed to an electoral political movement or paramilitary groups, as was the case in Europe. Though it wasn't really the high military ranks, more the lower-middle officers, especially the younger ones. Those at the top utilised the fascist junior officers to push their own interests, but they weren't usually ideological fascists themselves.  I'd argue that a crucial difference (though not the only one) between Japanese and European fascism is the role of the supreme leader. In Nazism, Hitler obviously completely monopolises this  in Italy, even though there's a King, Mussolini is able to become the supreme leading figure. In Japan, on the other hand, there's no real prospect of having a supreme leader other than the Emperor, so Japanese fascist movements never feel the need for a charismatic leader figure of their own.  There's also the different geopolitical situations, which depending on how you look at it is down to either racism or NIMBY from Europe  Japan can get away with a lot more simply because the European powers don't care as much about China or Korea as they do about Poland or Austria. So conservatives in Japan can have a policy of *some* territorial conquest to appease the fascists in a way that conservatives in Germany could never have feasibly pulled off.;

To me it really seems as if you're staring at the reality but won't allow yourself to accept it.  But to give you something of the little that has been said:  &gt Under Putin, theft by officials has gone from a bad situation to a catastrophic one...Our international corruption ratings are confirmed by Russian government data. According to RosStat, the number of crimes recorded under the category “Corruption” rose by 87% between 2000 and 2009 – from 7000 to 13000.  &gt According to Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation V. Lebedev, in 2008 only 25% of persons accused of bribe-taking received prison terms while 65% were given suspended sentences. Back when we published “Putin: The Results”, talk of Putin’s mighty personal friends with access to billions – Timchenko, the Kovalchuk brothers, the Rotenberg brothers – circulated only as rumours. Now, however, all these people can be found quite officially in the listings of Russian billionaires. According to Forbes magazine, Gennadi Timchenko is 36th in that list, with a wealth of $1.9 billion. Yuri Kovalchuk comes in at #67 with nearly $1 billion. Brothers Arkadi and Boris Rotenberg occupy slots 99 and 100 with a combined wealth of $1.4 billion. Putin has installed at the feeding trough not only his closest friends, but their relatives too. Yuri Kovalchuk’s son Boris was, at the age of 29, placed at the head of the Department of National Projects of the Government of Russia, which he ran from 2006 to 2009. When National Projects was rolled up, Boris Kovalchuk was given the post of Deputy Director of RosAtom and in late 2009 sent to head InterRAO, the state monopoly for electricity import/export. Meanwhile, Yuri Kovalchuk’s brother Mikhail heads the Kurchatov Institute [Russia's leading research and development institution in the field of nuclear energy - Trans.],  which the state has been financing in recent years to the tune of tens of billions of roubles. The Rotenberg brothers built their business on supplying pipes and providing building services to Gazprom. This despite the fact that they neither made nor built anything. Back in 2003-2004, Boris Rotenberg was a junior partner in Gaztaged, a company with a turnover of about $1 billion, through which pipe purchases for Gazprom were routed. He later acquired shares in SEPT (North European Pipe Project), a pipe-trading company with a turnover of around $1.5 billion which is going to supply pipes to the North Stream pipeline project. Arkadi Rotenberg controls StroiGasMontazh, a group which in 2008 bought controlling shares in 5 Gazprom subsidiaries making pipelines for the North Stream, the “Olympic” Dzhubga-Lazarevskoye-Sochi, and other pipeline projects. In 2008, Timchenko’s partner in oil-trader Gunvor, Torbjörn Törnqvist, admitted in a letter to the editor of British newspaper The Guardian that Gunvor does have a “third beneficiary”. But who that is, no one knows.  &gt Putin declared that his income for 2009 amounted to 3.9 million roubles (~$125,000). On this income, our prime-minister was able to give a boy shepherd in the Tula region a wristwatch worth $10,500 only magically to be seen wearing a new model of the same a few days later. Medvedev, who declared that he earned 3.3 million roubles (~$106,000) in 2009, owns a flat in the super-élite Zolotye Klyuchi apartment complex, where the maintenance charge alone is at least $5000 a month. The watch Medvedev wears costs $32,200. The president’s and the prime-minister’s suits come from Brioni and Kiton (these go for €5000-7000 a shot) and are what Russia’s billionaires prefer. Against the backdrop of the collapse in road-building and of much of the country’s infrastructure, our country’s leaders are building and restoring residences for their beloved selves out of the state budget  About Putin caring for his people:  &gt Putinist mythology would have it that we are seeing successes on the demography front, that the birth rate is rising, and so on and so forth. This is compounded by spreading another myth that the country “was dying out in the 1990s”. Let us look at the facts.Our population at 1 January 1992 was 148.5 million people, at 1 January 2000 it was 146.9 million. (Table data from RosStat). The drop between these two dates was therefore 1.6 million. At 1 January 2010, Russia’s population numbered 141.9 million, giving a drop of a whopping 5 million between 2000 and 2010.  &gt The bitter truth therefore is that Russia has been losing 500,000 people a year over the last decade, a rate that bears no comparison with even the 1990s.  &gt The main reason that our population is declining is supermortality. Around 15 per 1000 die every year. In July 2009, Russia could be found 12th from the bottom in the global mortality listing. Our neighbour on the list are Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Chad, Somali. **We have been maintaining African mortality levels in our country for many years now.** The problem is supermortality. The Russian government does not care for its population. One million six hundred thousand babies are born every year while 2,100,000 people die.  &gt Russian mortality rates began to rise in the 1970s under Brezhnev and continued to do so right up to the mid 1990s. In 1995, mortality began to decrease and fell to under 2 million a year in 1998. Under Putin, however, rates rose again and accelerated to reach a new peak in 2003, when 2.37 million deaths were recorded. The rate has not dropped below 2 million since then.  &gt Russia’s exceptionally high mortality is the result of a concatenation of reasons. Nearly 60% of deaths are recorded as from cardiovascular causes, another 15% from cancer. Respiratory organs and digestive tracts claim another 4% each. Russia is outstanding for its number of deaths from external causes – 12.5% of the total or more than 260,000 people annually. This is approximately twice as many as in China or Brazil and 4-5 time more than in Western countries.  You can read the report here: http://www.putin-itogi.ru/putin-what-10-years-of-putin-have-brought  If you really want to dig into it, there's a lot more.  &gt The country was looted after perestroika and **the special minority oligarchs started festering**.  Putin is par of that oligarchy.  ;

westalist55;worldnews;2015-03-17 18:47:07;Of course Ukraine is a cluster fuck, the Russians have been abusing them for hundreds of years. Stalin routinely carried out horrid policies that devastated Ukraine, including the Holodomor. Ukraine took the brunt of the beating in World War 2. Then came the nuclear disaster, a result of Soviet Engineering incompetence.    Finally, with the Euromaidan, it looked like Ukraine could finally throw off the Russian yoke, and realigning itself to the West, and advance as a country. Naturally, Putin wouldn't have that.

AquilaGlobumAncora;AskReddit;2015-03-17 18:51:51;Most politicians only talk about infrastructure, Hitler was the infrastructure king. Dude built dams, bridges, improved roads and came up with the autobahn, the first highway.  He had a huge animal rights campaign and passed some of the first modern laws regarding animal cruelty. He was even vegetarian and encouraged others to do so.  Hitler also mandated that all employers provide lunch breaks to its workers and IIRC something about having bathrooms as well and the 40 hour work week.  He killed the national bank, the same banks that led the worldwide depression.  He also fought usury. The same nationalized banks that Hitler was against was the same banks that JFK and Occupy Wall Street was against.  Hitler also tried to deport Jews wealth intact to Palestine and Madagascar for some reason. Supposedly he didn't want to kill anyone. Also, the whole "Hitler was a racist" thing is untrue. Hitler had black, mongolian, islamic, and other races in his ranks. He even had certified Nazi Qurans printed for his islamic troops. He just thought that the races should be separate yet equal and that they should strive to make themselves better to strengthen their race so that humanity as a whole improved.   As far as the whole Master Race thing goes Nazi Germany completely dominated the 1936 Olympics and it was simply him pushing the strong and smart should reproduce, while those with inheritable disease should not.;

Lightning-Dust;videos;2015-03-17 18:57:48;It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches  anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare  a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?;

beatles-in-space;AskHistorians;2015-03-17 19:00:42;President Truman had an ambitious domestic agenda, which he called the "Fair Deal", which stalled in front of a Republican-controlled Congress. In the 1948 campaign, he ran against the "do-nothing Congress", which turned out to be a successful political strategy, although it didn't improve his legislative prospects. An image of ineffectual leadership is never good.  He also had an ambitious foreign policy agenda which was much more successful. This included the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Berlin Airlift, Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, North Atlantic Treaty, and the Korean War. You have to remember that isolationist sentiment was still very strong in the United States. Truman's presidency was crucial because he kept the United States intimately involved in international relations in the post-World War II period. But a substantial faction of Republicans was opposed to some or all of these policies. In particular, the Korean War was carried out without a declaration of war and under the auspices of enforcing the UN Charter, under UN auspices and with the authority of a UN Security Council resolution. Imagine what that must have meant to a country which 30 years earlier had rejected the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations! And furthermore, the war turned into a stalemate, in which tens of thousands of American troops were killed. Dwight Eisenhower came into office largely on the back of this issue, and the idea that Truman was overextending the country. His corrective was to reign in the Korean War-era defense budget and put much more emphasis on nuclear deterrence, creating the Cold War as we know it. It was a sort of "return to normalcy" (to quote Warren Harding) that the American people were looking for. Eisenhower normalized the Cold War and had a simultaneously more unilateral and more restrained foreign policy.;

Pochetnyy;AMA;2015-03-17 19:02:47;I'm afraid that's not the case. The collapse of the USSR was brought on by a failing economy, which was a result of constant war and Reagan-like management, repression of personal liberties, as it wasn't a Communist Nation, over-extension, and pressure from every first world country. When Lenin took power his policies alienated the class peasantry, which is a testament to how careless he was, and then Stalin took power and well... This would never happen in a real Communism. Of course people are naturally selfish, but the law in terms of wealth gain really only restricts the expropriation of labor. So in principle, if people want more money, they can make more money, all they have to do is work hard, or gain a more valuable job.;

There is a long tradition of simplistic ideologues rejecting science that didn't fit in with their belief systems. Adolf Hitler rejected what he called "Jewish Physics" in favour of "Aryan Physics" and drove Einstein and many other brilliant physicists out of European giving the Allies the expertise to develop the atomic bomb.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik#Effect_on_the_German_nuclear_program  Joseph Stalin rejected establishe­­­­­­­d agricultur­­­­­­­al science in favour of the nonsense promoted by Trofim Lysenko and the result was that the Soviet Union could not feed it's own population and in fact millions starved.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko  Mao Tse-tung ignored the establishe­­­­­­­d science of metallurgy and embarked on a program of small-scal­­­­­­­e production of iron and steel. The result was a disaster called the Great Leap Forward.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Leap_Forward  In 1995 Thabo Mbeki announced his belief that the human immunodefi­­­­­­­cien­c­y virus (HIV) is not the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). I wouldn't put him in the same category as the first three I mentioned but here we see a similar rejection of scientific consensus in favour of an ad hoc belief system.

HawaiiFO;todayilearned;2015-03-17 19:19:09;Briton also had plans to take out 90% of Soviet oil production by bombing Baku from Iran/Iraq if the German/Soveit pact had held and they kept trading oil with Germany.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pike  "an oil shortage would cripple the Red Army and Soviet Air Force, as well as Soviet collective farm machinery, causing possible widespread famine and even the collapse of the Soviet Union: "Dependence on oil supplies from the Caucasus is the fundamental weakness of Russian economy. The Armed Forces were totally dependent on this source also for their motorized agriculture. More than 90% of oil extraction and 80% of refinement was located in the Caucasus (primarily Baku). Therefore, interruption of oil supplies on any large scale would have far-reaching consequences and could even result in the collapse of all the military, industrial and agricultural systems of Russia."  IMO, this would have also been Germany's best shot at taking out The USSR at the start of Barbarossa. Hitlers folly up intill and including Stalingrad ( where he broke off 25% of Stalingrads starting attacking force to try and take Baku intact, rather than get Stalingrad over with quickly, then and only then mop up Baku after cutting them off) was Germany didn't need ANY extra oil for themselfs if the USSR also wasn't producing very much.    If German stratagy from the start, The Germans would have needed to conquer at least 200-300 miles into the Ukraine to set up airfields with the bombers capable of reaching Baku round trip (range at the time). If planned better they could have also maybe sent in 25,000 men in gliders on a one way suicide/sabatoge mission to Baku instead of wasting them on Crete. Once the Germans started landing the Russians may have even sabotaged all their own oil producing apparatus for them. Once destroyed, needing to invade deep in the USSR may have been unnessessaraly for their surrender.   ;

It would be rather pointless for me to describe an ancap utopia to you, because you'll just dismiss it as fantasy and I would do the same for your description of your utopia.  As a method to be somewhat objective, I will define the worst case scenario of marxism and you define the worst case scenario of capitalism. So isn't it fair to say that todays system of capitalism is the worst case? So my point is that the worst case is what we have right now, whereas the marxist worst case is stalin or mao. Regardless it's worse than what we have right now.  &gt  They'd be galled at you making that mistake too.  Rothbard and Hayek would be galled at you to suggest we have a free market today.

pgmog;BipolarReddit;2015-03-17 19:23:40;I worked for a "big pharma" company for two years on the data side of drug discovery. I know the drill. I'm very familiar with its shortcomings and limitations, but as Churchill said "Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the rest that have been tried." That's how I feel about Western medicine.  You know what else has proven antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anti-convulsant properties? Melatonin. Good ol' *aux naturale* Melatonin! A hormone found in abundance nearly in every living creature. Perfectly legal and available OTC at the Rite Aid/CVS near you. Why not decry the under-use of melatonin in current available treatment? Because it's simply not sexy enough for you to latch onto. It doesn't have quiet the same panache of an acrimonious battle between the East against the West (I know which side I'm on...). If it were illegal in the states we would have the exact same discussion about it right now. Convince me that CBD is superior to melatonin in treating BP and epilepsy.  Your reasoning is so riddled with fallacies I'm not sure where to start.  1) Okay there is not enough research on CBD. So, because we don't know enough about it, it must mean that it is better somehow? Splain'  2) Cannabis is thousands of years old. Alcohol is even older, ancient in fact (it's mentioned in the Bible!). Alcohol has strongly proven antiinflammatory properties in moderate amounts. So according to your logic alcohol should be used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis? Wut.  3) The polio vaccine is also in its infancy as medicine for human consumption. Didn't make it any less effective...and there sure as shit wasn't anything in Eastern medicine that could be used to even start to mimick its effects. Old is not always good. New is not always bad. Conclusion: it's not the time a substance has been used that counts, but rather the time it has been **scientifically** observed. Prescience time are like dog years to post-science time.  4) Modern Western research may be laughable to you, but *it's the best game in town*. You can justifiably sneer at the sorry state of humanity, but this is the best thing we have to offer. The only alternatives are hearsay and superstitions.   5) University funded studies are superior I agree of which there are many that have been done on Lithium.  6) This is simply nonsense. What a "drug does" can always be broken down to its desirable (effects) and undesirable (side-effects) parts. If it has no undesirable effects, then it has no side-effects. These are just really basic a priori definitions there, nothing really to contend. What are you saying? Eastern medicine consists of drugs that only have desirable effects. What fallacy?  7) Instead of pointing out the fallacy here, let me just make a slight adjustment to what you already wrote:  &gt  Again, I'm not suggesting anyone here try any of this for themselves, I'm simply stating that from a chemical standpoint we know what *Melatonin* is capable of, and we know it is non-lethal with a lower side effect profile then Lithium. We also know it has neuroprotective properties, anticonvulsant properties, and antioxidant properties. As a compound, *Melatonin* is already what it is.  Hmmmm......  ;

asdfman2000;AskMen;2015-03-17 19:27:18;I agree. It's a good thing southern states were forced to integrate and treat minorities with respect similar to how northern states. Ferguson is a perfect example. An unarmed black man would never be murdered by police in New York.  You'd never see segregation in this bastion of freedom. Certainly not the 10 most segregated cities in the US: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#Contemporary_segregation   Look: There is no perfect system. The constitution and federal government is there to ensure basic civil rights and equal protection, but ultimately any democracy requires a compassionate, informed citizenry.  A strong central government isn't a cure-all (and neither is decentralization). You point to American slavery and post-slavery as what's wrong with decentralization, but seem to forget the horrors under Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin, or even the internment of Japanese-Americans all happened under strong central governments. Remember, it was the federal government the prosecuted war against the American Indians.

Also it's more valuable the worse off you are - you don't give a shit about your rights, you give a shit that you can't eat every day. So what if you can't complain about the government if they feed you?  They used their dictatorship style rule to build a strong economy. Also, they did their best to court American investment.  This model has been repeated with small changes by South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan if you want to see it work on a larger scale. Even China to some extent.  What it leads to is that a strong state will facilitate economic growth and that people will allow it to as long as they don't sacrifice too many liberties in the process of gaining better status. Stalin and Mao style economic changes don't work anymore (the world is too interconnected) so you can't just mass murder people to get industrialization. But you can dictate policy (similar to an enlightened despot).;
