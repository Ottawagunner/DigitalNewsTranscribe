rugger647,history,2015-03-09 19:23,George Carlin... “The next time they give you all that civic bullshit about voting keep in mind that Hitler was elected in a full free democratic election” 
ChurchillianGrooves,history,2015-03-09 19:57,Sort of agree.  Imperialism was already winding down for a number of reasons  1. Post-colonialism: allows the exploitation of countries without directly taking them over (think Nike factories or Foxconn in Asia)   2. Growing opposition among the population in Imperialist countries (whether due to political ideology or just on a cost basis)  3. Colonies acquiring greater infrastructure and technology making them less dependent on the Imperial powers  4.  Growing nationalism in colonies   5.  Economies becoming more dependent on machinery (and skilled workers) than manpower (as in an agrarian society)  I'm sure there are more but these are the larger reasons I could come up with off the top of my head.  I wouldn't say Hitler caused the end of Imperialism.  WWI and WWII certainly sped up the process though.  While I do agree with you that British and French colonialism were horrible and often glossed over they were no where near as bad as the Nazis or even the Soviets.  Many millions of people were outright killed or starved to death in concentration camps and gulags.  Many of the independence movements in the colonies were already well underway even before WWI so you can't really say that Hitler lead to their independence.  Ho Chi Minh was at the treaty of Versaille at the end of WWI arguing for Vietnamese independence after all.  The Indian independence movement was also active pre WWI. 
Genessender,history,2015-03-09 22:42,Nevertheless in 1939 and 1940 slightly more than half of all immigrants to the United States were Jewish most of them refugees from Europe. In 1941 45% of all immigrants to the United States were Jewish. After the United States entered the war in December 1941 the trickle of immigration virtually dried up just at the time that the Nazi regime began systematically to murder the Jews of Europe. Despite many obstacles however more than 200000 Jews found refuge in the United States from 1933 to 1945 most of them before the end of 1941.  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005182  People recognized long before the start of the war that Hitler was threatening genocide. Hitler himself said so. 
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 3:23,Stalin wasn't heavily involved in the war but it's widely believed from official accounts that Kim Il-Sung received his 'go-ahead' to start the war directly from Stalin and Mao.
TheEllimist,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 5:41,Perhaps that means the journal(s) of people that had contact with Stalin? 
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 5:51,Makes for a good joke but Hitler was appointed not elected.
Bigglesworth_,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 7:01,"That's not quite right  Dowding's strategy was to preserve Fighter Command as a force in being to deny the Luftwaffe air superiority rather than to shoot down as many bombers as possible the preferred strategy of e.g. Sholto Douglas but Dowding broadly left tactical decisions to his group commanders. 11 Group's Keith Park prioritised early interception of German raids by whatever fighters could reach them soonest more in line with Dowding's strategy whereas 12 Group's Trafford Leigh-Mallory favoured the ""Big Wing"" taking the time to assemble multiple squadrons for a massed attack with some support from Douglas and others at the Air Ministry not least thanks to lobbying from the likes of Douglas Bader backed up by large numbers of claimed kills that in post-war analysis turned out to be wildly optimistic.  There was considerable personal acrimony between Park and Leigh-Mallory and from Leigh-Mallory towards Dowding for giving Park command of 11 Group. There was a famous staff conference on October 17th 1940 concerning Day Fighter Tactics that turned out to be a ""Big Wing"" ambush chaired by Douglas with heated discussions primarily between Park and Leigh-Mallory and little input from Dowding concluding that Leigh-Mallory's tactics were correct. Dowding wasn't popular and had been due to be replaced as Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command before the war  he wasn't court-martialed as a result of the October conference but he was rather unceremoniously shuffled out of Fighter Command in November 1940 lack of success in intercepting night raids being the final nail in his coffin.  There was a suggestion that Dowding's silence at the conference was deliberate and that he could have referred to Ultra intelligence to prove that Park's tactics (and by extension Dowding's strategy) were correct but he chose to preserve the Ultra secret. This (and the more general impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain) is disputed by e.g. John Terraine in *The Right of the Line* and Harry Hinsley in *British Intelligence in the Second World War*. According to Sebastian Cox in *A Comparative Analysis of RAF and Luftwaffe Intelligence in the Battle of Britain 1940* Dowding may not even have been aware of the true nature of Ultra at the time as a minute from Churchill on October 16th asked that Cs-in-C of Fighter and Bomber Command be let in on the secret though other accounts suggest he may have known from August."
bang531,history,2015-03-10 9:41,The responsibility for the Korean War falls solely on Stalin. Mao would not have wanted a war so close to China's doorstep. He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea. The UN forces and MacArthur have been warned that any incursion across the Yalu is an act of war and MacArthur was inching to go into China on the back of his successful push back against the North Korean army after the Inchon landing. He was even thinking of using the atomic bomb against China. Of course Truman fired him basically for insubordination when he ignored orders not to expand the war. After all the forces in Korea were there under the auspices of the UN not the US and the mandate was to stop the North Korean not expand the war into China
Herge,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 11:37,So the week in question was from June 22nd to ? And that Stalin was still in contact with the politburo during all this?  It still does not sound like a week-long mental breakdown.
Mrman53,history,2015-03-10 12:40,My perception is that Kim wanted the war and the fact that Stalin allowed it to happen was huge.  Edit: leading up to the Korean conflict Kim Il Sung asked the CCP multiple times to aid the invasion. Finally Stalin said yes and sent weapons to help the DRPK. If the DPRK would have gone without Russian aid there would most defiantly be a different story.  Edit: fixed names
zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 13:22,His party was by far the largest party in Germany. Hindenburg named him Chancellor due to pressure from his conservative/army buddies who thought they could use Hitler's large number of elected representatives to rule.  IIRC the parliament was completely paralyzed because there was no government that could be formed at that point with an absolute majority so the only way to get anything done was to rule by presidential decree. Everyone wanted a democratic ruler and the conservatives compromised by making a coalition with the nazis where he got the chancellery and they got most of the ministries giving that coalition the elected weight to rule without decree.  So he didn't have absolute majority but it was an impossible feat for the most part to get a majority with tens of parties all getting votes.  source : Rise and fall of the Third Reich
vet_laz,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 13:45,/u/kieslowskifan and /u/international_KB   thank you both for your replies!  @ /u/kieslowskifan  thanks for linking to the research by Harrison I've already started reading and its quite interesting! Add to the fact that its free as well! I had looked online for books on this particular subject but oddly everything I could find (on amazon that is) was in the $100-150 price range. They didn't appear to be text books either? I found that really strange.   I've only just begun to understand the dire situation the Soviets were faced with in 1942. Mainly it has to do with what I've read about the fighting around Moscow and Rzhev in '42. I'm interested to know more about these battles and I'll look into getting books that specifically cover the subject because everything I own and have read so far  overshadows this conflict with what happened in the south during Case Blue and then at Stalingrad. If you have any pointers on reading materials in thus regard I'll gladly take note. Cheers!  @ /u/international_KB  I wanted to say first and foremost that your reply didn't seem offhand or hastily written. I'm not a student or academic so I don't have crazy standards or anything hahaha. No offense to students or academics!  I watched a documentary recently that said government reports from the time stated something like a million freight cars had been shipped east by rail during the initial stages of the invasion. Unofficially it was said that if you had lined up these freight cars from end to end they would have stretched from the original western borders all the way to the Pacific. Whether that claim is true or not I think what was accomplished is nothing short of astonishing. If I'm not mistaken I seem to recall having read that several tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of freight cars were caught in a massive traffic jam further to the east of the Volga in the southern part of the union as they were moved east.  Just let me know if this is covered in the writings by Harrison as I've only just started with them. You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines? To my understanding after the defeats suffered during 1941 and with portions of the war industry having been transported cross country and then needing to be subsequently reestablished the winter and spring portions of 1942 can be seen as perhaps the darkest period for the Red Army. New formations were created to replace the losses sustained the year prior but arming these new units was set back by the situation within the munitions industry as a whole. Something that would have a major effect on the Red Army as they attempted to push the Germans further back from the Moscow area in the first half of '42. Correct?  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  I've taken note of the two books you mentioned and I'll look into purchasing them at a later date. Cheers!    **At that I thank the both of you for helping me further my understanding on the subject!**  *This doesn't have to be answered if its considered trivial or irrelevant but the question is in relation to Soviet agriculture. Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals? When speculating about alternate outcomes of the eastern front I've read the argument that the Soviets would have retreated into Siberia and continued the resistance from there although it doesn't seem like there would be any significant portion of farmland based there beforehand?* 
Serpenz,history,2015-03-10 14:15,&gt  He just won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and has to worry about the 7th Fleet along the Taiwan Strait.  The 7th Fleet was sent there after the start of the Korean War. Truman had stood by while Mao had defeated Chiang in mainland China and was ready to allow the same to happen in Taiwan but the invasion of South Korea was one of a number of events that convinced him Mao was an instrument in Soviet global policy rather than an Asian Tito (a nationalist communist independent of Moscow). Note that the fleet was also meant to prevent Chiang from trying to reconquer the mainland.  &gt  The reason China entered the war was McArthur's insistence on crossing the Yalu River which separates China from Korea.  MacArthur's forces didn't cross the Yalu (or Tumen). I'm not entirely sure they actually reached the rivers. But regardless of whether or not US forces were about to cross into Manchuria in 1950 Mao didn't want them at his border.
DatDinkleberg,history,2015-03-10 14:56,The main instigator of the Korean War was Syngman Rhee not Kim Il-Sung nor Stalin he excluded leftists and communists from politics his forces also did the Mungyeong massacre blamed it on communist guerrillas jailed nearly 30000 communists and enrolled nearly 300000 suspected sympathizers in the Bodo League. Kim Il-Sung attacked the South just to free it's people from the oppression of this rightist dictator.
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:15,This is a very post-hoc justification for the use of the atomic bombs and one that was not promulgated officially until 1947. You can read more about this here (the excellent blog of our own /u/restricteddata): http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/08/the-decision-to-use-the-bomb-a-consensus-view/  The whole entry is great but the pertinent responses to your points above are probably:   &gt  It’s not really clear that Truman ever made much of a “decision” or regarded the bomb/invasion issue as being mutually exclusive. Truman didn’t know if the bomb would end the war  he hoped but he didn’t know couldn’t know. The US was still planning to invade in November 1945. They were planning to drop as many atomic bombs as necessary. There is no contemporary evidence that suggests Truman was ever told that the causalities would be X if the bomb was dropped and Y if it was not. There is no evidence that prior to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Truman was particularly concerned with Japanese causalities radiation effects or whether the bombs were ethical or not. The entire framing of the issue is ahistorical after-the-fact here. It was war  Truman had atomic bombs  it was taken for granted at that point that they were going to be used.   and   &gt  Personally I don’t wade into these questions much professionally or even here on the blog. They honestly don’t interest me very much. Maybe it’s a sign of how post-post-Cold War I am? I don’t know. To me it has always seemed like splitting very fine hairs trying to make distinctions without much difference. In my mind the atomic bombings were plainly not ethically very different than the previous firebombings of Japan or Germany. To argue about whether they were justified or not seems to me to be the wrong question — a question that misleads us into mistaking what the core issue was.  &gt For me the better question is **under what circumstances do we believe the use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians is justified?**  That gets one into much more interesting ethical territory in my opinion than asking why the bombs were used a question that seems to presume that the motivations are somehow the most important thing to ask about. It also keeps us from having the same old discussion that people have been having for nearly 70 years. Maybe it’s my post-postness talking here but whether people in the past had *better or worse intentions* **before** *setting a hundred thousand people on fire* seems like the least interesting historical question to pose in the face of such actions.  (emphasis in original) 
quant271,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 15:17,Stalin made a graduation speech at the Soviet army officers academy in which he told the to expect war with Germany soon.   I don't think Whaley had a direct statement from Stalin about an ultimatum but he had the German records from Intelligence and Diplomacy and some Soviet material which support the inference.  The Germans were trying to push the ultimatum idea as a deception plan.     I'll have to reread that book.  Since the book came out before the collapse of the Soviet Union it would be very interesting to look at this again in light of the documents available now.
stillbevens,history,2015-03-10 16:00,Churchill was one of the architects of this operation btw
Speakease,history,2015-03-10 16:09,This election was actually a political loss for the NSDAP furthermore the SPD and KPD were gradually cooperating with each-other which was a potential immediate future threat to them. This naturally changed with Hitlers appointment to Chancellor at the urgings of various leading members of Government and it only took a year for him to consolidate power using his new position.
zsimmortal,history,2015-03-10 16:22,What????  The Socialists actually despised the Communists MOST of all. They perceived them as their main threat even though the nazi star had started shining again and quickly moved past them. Without question something that helped Hitler gain seats and eventually the chancellery since his 2 main opponents were divided and unwilling to cooperate.  source : same as above
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 16:46,"On August 14 1941 Franklin Roosevelt together with Winston Churchill released a joint declaration which was to go under the name of the *Atlantic Charter*. For this question the sixth clause is the most important one: ""After the final destruction of Nazi tyranny they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.”   This charter alongside its sixth clause had a tremendous effect in the world and while Winston Churchill was quick to reassure his government that the charter did not apply to the British Empire Roosevelt had meant for it to apply universally. FDR had entered the 1940s with a strong anti-colonialist conviction. This of course extended to the belief that France should give up French Indochina (modern day Vietnam Cambodia and Laos). FDR felt very strongly about the possibility that Indochina had been used by the Japanese as a springboard for the initial conquests in 1942 (it wasn't) and adding onto his generally bleak opinion about the French after its defeat in 1940 made him very determined to speak out against French colonialism in Indochina.  This does not mean that Roosevelt saw Indochina was being prepared for independence. Roosevelt had at occasions displayed in the words of Fredrik Logevall a ""patronizing and cryptoracist view of the Vietnamese"" and considered them unfit to rule themselves. Instead he suggested a more paternalistic suggestion in which a *trusteeship* would be established along the lines of the mandate system of the League of Nations. These former colonies would be helped to independence through a series of stages culminating in total independence.  Roosevelt was very reluctant in allow Free French regular forces to return to Indochina and while he began to look the other way as Free French forces were deployed with the help from the British towards the end of his own life (and the war) Roosevelt still remained convinced that allowing France to return to Indochina was a bad idea - even though it began to falter due to the realities of the war itself. To Roosevelt the final (and inevitable) goal was universal decolonization."
jschooltiger,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:11,"&gt  had no intention of ending the war before a land invasion could take place just seems to ignore this basic reality.  That's not what I'm saying. The American leadership was happy that the bombs (in combination with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria -- the degree to which each of these put pressure on the Japanese leadership to surrender is a lively debate) were a factor in forcing the Japanese to surrender.   What I'm saying is that a common justification for the atomic bombings which was only promulgated after the war is that the bombs were used specifically by the American leadership to force Japan to surrender *instead of* a land invasion.   The argument usually runs something like ""well we killed a lot of civilians but it avoided (x million) American and Japanese casualties.""   The issue I take with that is threefold:   1) the atomic bombings understood in the context of the war were a continuation of a deliberate policy of destroying Japanese (and German) cities with the attendant understanding that fire bombings would cost hundreds of thousands of civilian lives. So the idea that the atomic bombings and the casualties that resulted from them were somehow a unique event is wrong.   2) The targets for the bombs were selected and the bombs themselves were dropped without really much if any oversight or reference to Truman or anyone else in his cabinet.   We have this post-facto idea that the top leadership agonized over the decision and reluctantly decided that the cost to civilians was outweighed by the rapidity of ending the war. As I said (quoting /u/restricteddata) in my earlier post Truman didn't make any such decision. He was fairly shocked by the use of the bombs and placed a moratorium on their future use after the Nagasaki bombing which further implies that he didn't fully understand their use or intended effect.   3) At the time the bombs were dropped plans for a land invasion of Japan were in full force -- the exigencies of the military situation and the time it would have taken to plan for an invasion meant that it had to be running at full speed when the bomb was dropped. Which further contravenes the idea that we held off on a land invasion and waited for the bombs to work. "
YxxzzY,history,2015-03-10 17:15,"Most know that they didn't have any choice. Especially when Hitler made almost all male persons that were able to hold and shoot a gun go to war.     People don't generally like to talk about the war itself here they talk about the regime there are no ""war-heroes"" like you might have in the US or any other allied nation.   Even tho my Grandfathers uncle was an ace no one ever told me until I started googling my surname  and asked a few questions. I think that is pretty cool but my parents and especially my grandparents  all of them born after the war think it's part of a bad and scary past they would rather forget about.  Just some unorganized thoughts  ). "
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 17:44,An excellent suggestion is Fredrik Logevall's *Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam* which covers the French Indochina War and early American involvement in Vietnam. It touches upon the US perspective quite often and how the US went from being against allowing the French to return under Roosevelt to complete support under Truman and Eisenhower.
DeadWeaselRoad,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:09,I took a Russian history course in last spring and my professor explained that Stalin did not have a real plan as far as what countries would come under the USSR's control but rather however far the Red Army would get would become part of the Soviet Union.   I can't speak to the Soviet leaders after him without being speculative so I won't.   This article might help you a bit.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/ir2/sovietexpansionineasterneuroperev1.shtml
International_KB,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 18:18,&gt  You had commented that if ever there were any shortages of munitions at the front it could solely be attributed to the Soviets overwhelmed supply lines?  To be clear my area of knowledge tends to be the Soviet economy as a whole rather than the specifics of logistical supply during the war. So the idea that any munitions crisis was the product of supply/transportation difficulties is pure conjecture. It may just be that the volumes produced while impressive simply weren't enough to cope with the intensity of the fighting. What I can say with confidence that Soviet armaments and munition production increased each year during the war and continually outstripped Germany. To quote from Adam Tooze's *Wages of Destruction*:  &gt  If there was a true 'armaments miracle' in 1942 it occurred not in Germany but in the armaments factories in the Urals. Despite having suffered territorial losses and disruption that resulted in a 25 per cent fall in total national product the Soviet Union in 1942 managed to out-produce Germany in virtually every category of weapons. The margin for small arms and artillery was 3:1. For tanks it was a staggering 4:1 a differential compounded by the superior quality of the T34 tank. Even in combat aircraft the margin was 2:1. It was this industrial superiority contrary to every expectation that allowed the Red Army first to absorb the Wehrmacht's second great onslaught and then in November 1942 to launch a whole series of devastating counterattacks.  But this is 1942. What is more accurate is to note is that in the 'darkest days' of the second half of 1941 there was an immense demand for munitions at precisely the time that production and transport were undergoing severe strain/dislocation. This was the period in which shortages of arms would have been greatest - as entire armies were lost and the economic mobilisation was still underway. From 1942 onwards (perhaps excluding Q1) however with the war economy established the problem became the opposite - how to avoid crashing the economy through excessive mobilisation.  &gt  Taking into consideration the front lines around the time period of 1941 and 42 was most of the remaining farmland still within Soviet possession situated between the Volga and the Urals?  Not quite. The USSR was split into a six agricultural producer/consumer regions three of each. Much of the Southern Producer Region (ie the Ukraine) was lost to the Germans along with a chunk of the Central Producer Region (which included the Volga area). But the Eastern Producer Region (Siberia and most of Central Asia) was unoccupied and continued to produce. However these areas were not as naturally productive as those lands in European Russia and comprised maybe 25% of overall grain production (based on some very rough maths by me drawing on Davies' *Years of Hunger*).  That said the agricultural situation was severe. Granted the Germans had 'relieved' Moscow of about a third of its population during their advance but they'd also (deliberately) seized the prime grain producing areas. In 1942 agricultural output was a mere 40% of the pre-war level. This continued to be a severe strain on the Soviet population and economy until a recovery of sorts in 1944-45.  &gt  This is simply conjecture on my part but it almost seems as though the actions taken by Stalin in the decade prior were an absolute necessity to the future survival of the USSR and its many differing ethnic groups. I'm not an apologist for Stalin and neither do I hold Communist sympathies but I can't imagine the Soviet Union having survived the war without their reliance on the major portions of industry that had been so ruthlessly built only a decade before. Add to that purges within the government society and the military had crafted a society of people who were familiar with and capable of surviving in unimaginable circumstances. Though obviously its easy for me to hold such an opinion when I myself never experienced the difficulties of the era.  Which is a topic that I won't go into much. What I will say is that while industrialisation was an objective shared by all Bolsheviks the Stalinist form that it ultimately took during the 1930s was incredibly wasteful. I'd also question why the Soviets needed to effectively rebuild their army from scratch in 1941 - Stalin's purging and flawed pre-war deployments much surely take much of the blame for the catastrophe of Barbarossa.
Cruentum,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:11,I never said it was. I think it was from June 22nd to July 3rd or 4th (when Stalin made his own speech to the Soviet Union which he never did before then).           Again the mental breakdown legend comes from Chakovsky (who wasn't there) and Khrushchev (who was there). Molotov (who was there) said he didn't do it as a mental breakdown but to sort things out and had left with Malenkov while keeping in contact. So yeah it does sound like he wasn't losing it as much as Khrushchev proclaimed. 
MisterBigStuf,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 19:52,Churchill you can't be serious?
JesuIsEveryNameTaken,history,2015-03-10 20:14,How was Churchill able to rebound politically years later after such a catastrophe? 
Gettodacchopper,history,2015-03-10 21:38,The short version is that he warned about Hitler and Germany when few wanted to think about it. 
adave4allreasons,history,2015-03-10 22:17,One of the most ill-conceived plans ever.  Just like Churchill's Italian campaign.  Apparently he never understood that mountains make a difference in battle.  
macros-the-black,history,2015-03-10 23:37,Churchill had a few howlers. But his successes were more numerous. And he was old money.   It's interesting to compare this to modern politics where one mistake can cost a politician their career because of the availability of information through myriad media channels.   Churchill got away some serious missteps in judgement and went on to become what many would consider a 'great leader'. Wonder how many 'great leaders' we've missed out on because of the unforgiving nature of modern politics. 
TheChosenOne127,AskHistorians,2015-03-10 23:47,Actually Hitler was convinced that the landings was happening at Calais. It's the main reason that some panzer divisions were not in Normandy at the time of D-Day. The operation was referred to as Operation Fortitude. Things could've gone a lot worse during D-Day.
THIS_IS_SO_HILARIOUS,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 4:48,I would be very careful to use Khrushchev for source on Stalin it been known that Khrushchev is known for distorting and lying on Stalin's activity. He was a victim of the Ukraine famine himself and did sought to destroy any reputation on Stalin even with lying.
This_Is_The_End,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:20,I didn't knew that. I believed the relationship was solely influenced by the support for mercenaries and Poland in the Polish-Sovjet war.  At least all this together gives a nice hint why Stalin made his movements. 
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 5:29,Perhaps I should have been more concrete: What i meant to say is that he saw Indochina as the springboard for *every* major loss and campaign during the initial Japanese conquest. This also includes the Philippines which clearly had a very urgent relevance for Roosevelt. 
ShootingPains,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 7:58,I recall that Beevor talks about an all woman anti-tank regiment in his Stalingrad book. 
cosmitz,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 8:06,is my memory failing or did the british use the Churchill hvac there? 
eadingas,history,2015-03-11 8:29,His entire political career is a series of controversies gaffes and misjudgements. He languished on the back benches for almost a decade. If it wasn't for the WWII he'd have likely been remembered as at best an average politician  at worst - a monster (he sanctioned the use of gas on the Kurds machine guns on striking workers and expressed a desire to brutally crush Indian independence movement among other things). But his tenacity verging on cruelty proved to be just the thing needed in a world war.    Also in the general carnage and mess that was WWI British people simply didn't pay as much attention to individual actions - and Gallipolli was relatively minor loss for the British forces. Maybe if Churchill was responsible for something like the Somme he'd never bounce back again.
Georgy_K_Zhukov,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:00,Yeah as the Germans approached Stalingrad Soviet forces in the region were sparse so they threw just about anything with a pulse at them to delay it. '*Narodnoe Opolcheniye*' or citizen levies were utilized and saw workers from the Barrikady Ordnance Factory the Red October Steel Works and the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory thrown at the Germans with little real training and very underarmed.
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:06,"The timeline you mentioned is somewhat off but the story itself is true. Hitler saw the prototype on November 26. 1943. He asked if the plane could be fitted with bombs. When the company answered yes Hitler agreed on the production if the design was turned into a ""Blitzbomber"".  Numerous people within the Luftwaffe disagreed and tried to persuade Hitler to use the plane as a fighter but it took until early 1945 until the Me 262 was used in the role it had been designed for. And while it was very dangerous as an interceptor there were too few to have a real impact on the war. The main advantages were the high speed which allowed the Me 262 to outrun escort fighters and the heavy armament.  Why did Hitler act this way? First Hitler in 1944 was not a very stable person. The strain of commanding the german army for years had taken its toll and he was abusing a lot of medical products. According the statements by people in his vicinity he was prone to fits of rage and depression and was very capable of acting irrational. Many people have classified him as clinically insane by this point.   While the actual motivations will remain unknown german-language sources claim that Hitler had a large desire for revenge against the western Allies. He hoped that the Me 262 would be able to bomb England and the allied forces with impunity - even though the payload was low and the design was not optimised for bombing runs."
jonewer,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:21,&gt  Are the likes of John Laffin Denis Winter Alan Clark and Liddell Hart really the entire reason for the emergence of that perspective?  Haig's descent from national hero *sans pareil* to comic book super-villain is something that I have been causally looking at recently hence my recent [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ynojf/when_did_the_war_poets_like_sassoon_and_owen/) on this sub about war poets.  So after the war he was much feted with some even fearing he might turn to politics and become a Mussolini type figure.   After his death we the publication of Lloyd-George's memoirs in the 1930's which is also when people like Edmonds and Liddell-Hart start cooking up mischief. Also of published at the time is Baker-Carr's book from which the (in)famous alleged quote about Haig and machine guns is to be mined. Nevertheless Haig's reputation holds up reasonably well in the 30's.  However it's really in the 1960's where things turn bad what with the publication of books by Clarke and Taylor while 'Oh what a Lovely War' achieves considerable popularity. There are some indication that Wilfred Owen's poetry becomes very popular at around this time.  It's maybe of note that the change in how Haig and the war was viewed coincided with the loss of large chunks of the Empire as well as with the general 1960's liberal consensus.  By the time Blackadder goes forth is broadcast in 1989 many school children's only exposure to the Great War is reading Owen's poetry in English classes with History classes picking up at Versailles through to Munich...  In 1998 (80 years after Victory) the Daily Express had a headline calling for Haig's statue to be removed with Clarke advocating it be vandalised as Haig was a mass murderer.  &gt  I recognize that the ‘Butcher’ Haig angle is very much on the decline right now but I still run into more moderate versions of it regularly  For the most part the 'rehabilitationist' view of Haig is confined to those who can actually be bothered to read a history book ie. a very small section of the population.  For the most part people's reactions to Haig are very much along the lines of Donkey through War Criminal to Mass Murderer and its hard to engage with such an ingrained concept in people who frankly aren't very interested in the first place.   
throwthetrash15,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:35,I like the answer. And I also understand that he indeed wanted a jet powered bomber that speed past allied fighters and bomb London- eventually New York- but what I don't understand is given the Me262's track record when it first was tested in actual combat he didn't actually bring to a reasonable production level. From my understanding he believed that repelling Overlord would mean a catastrophic loss for the Allies. This would allow him to focus in the East and potentially win the war. In the book D-Day Ambrose states that the Allies needed Air SUPREMACY (which they had at a great cost) over France to succeed with D-Day Hitler knew this as well. Why did he not see that a Jet fighter at this point could potentially challenge and quickly bring the superiority to him?
AusHaching,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:49,The Me 262 was barely ready for frontline service in summer 1944. Even if Hitler had decided to use the Me 262 as a fighter it would not have been avaiable in large enough numbers to change the outcome of the war.   You should also consider that Germany did not have the resources or the manpower to keep building the proven piston-engined fighters and set up a completely new production for jet fighters. The numerical superiority of allied fighters was simply too large.  And - last but not least - pilots had to be trained for the new plane. A jet fighter behaves very differently to a piston-engined fighter and Germany did not have a surplus of trained pilots quite to the contrary.
sk_2013,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 9:54,I'm pretty sure he means the AVRE unless Churchill had a secret weapon centering around central air.
norhis,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 10:09,"According to ""Grunnbok i Norges Historie page 292-293"" you are correct. Quisling was the leader of a party called National Assembly Nasjonal Samling in Norwegian. On the 9th of April he proclaimed himself as the new prime minister of a government who was willing to co-operate with the Reich. The Norweigan Supreme Court did not like Quisling much. On the 15th of April they voted to assemble an Administrative Councel. On April 24 Hitler made Josef Terboven Reichkommisar. The Germans wanted to distance themselfs from Quisling in order to establish a connection with the legitimate Norwegian government instances. This was mostly so they with the cooperation of the Parliament could establish a government and work against the Norwegian Government in London.   Sources:   Helle et al. 2013.

kieslowskifan,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 11:08,"The story of the Me-262's use as a bomber is somewhat convoluted and exaggerated in postwar memoirists such as Adolf Galland. In February 1943 a *Führerbefehl* decreed that all fighter aircraft should provision for bomb racks so they could be used as fighter-bombers. Willy Messerschmitt then incorporated the provision for bomb racks into the design and began development on paper for pure bomber variants of the 262.  In September 1943 Messerschmitt personally assured Hitler that the 262 could be used as a high-speed bomber over southern England.  When Hitler saw a 262 on display he inquired whether it could carry bombs and Messerschmitt again affirmed that the 262 could carry a decent bomb load. From all this Hitler got the impression that the 262 was analogous to the Ar234 a bomber that would use speed to evade enemy defenses. By January 1944 at a conference with Milch and Speer Hitler stressed that the bomb load of the 262 should be increased so when a *Jagerstab* conference on aircraft production the following May noted that the 262 was to be a fighter Hitler thought his orders were being deliberately flaunted. Milch tried to argue the case for the 262 as a fighter but Hitler would have none of it. Goering subsequently sent out a directive stating ""The Führer has ordered that the Me 262 is to be operated purely as a high-speed bomber. There is to be no mention of it as a fighter until further notice.""   So what impact did this have on the deployment of the 262? Not very much. The bomber variants of the 262 were already in development long before the May 1944 *Jagerstab* conference. The 262 program like many high-technology programs was beset by technical issues which were compounded by Germany's shortages of strategic materials.  The greatest problem for the 262 was what made it so revolutionary: its engines. The Junkers Jumo 004 selected for the 262 after its intended powerplant the  BMW 003 fell hopelessly behind schedule was a persnickety design and ersatz materials gave it a very short design life. The bugs within the engine were difficult to iron out and prevented any full-scale deployment of the 262 in early 1944.  Furthermore a shortage of trained workers and the pressures of dispersal of factories caused by Allied bombing put a ceiling on how many 262s could be produced.   The 262 as bomber entered into postwar memory as an example of Hitler's strategic myopia. Postwar Luftwaffe veterans would argue that but for the  Führer the 262 could have entered into production earlier and turned the tide of the air war. Writers such as Ambrose uncritically repeated this  line was but the reality was the 262 arguably went into service as early as it could have given the circumstances. Luftwaffe pilots also had great difficulty coming up with new tactics and formations which to use the 262 effectively. The convoluted nature of the 262's bomber interlude does indict the Third Reich on a different set of charges. The polycratic nature of the Third Reich where there were multiple centers of power all dependent upon Hitler's approval meant that German officials were inclined to try and court the Führer's opinion. Messerschmitt like many other technical experts in the aviation industry often misled or exaggerated aviation developments to suit Hitler's expectations. In the example of the 262 Willy Messerschmitt conflated paper projects for a pure 262 bomber with the emerging new design which just had bomb racks.   *Sources*  Boyne Walter J. *Messerschmitt Me 262: Arrow to the Future*.

twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:31,Margaret Thatcher for US President Winston Churchill for UK PM Ghengis Khan for Russian President All at the same time in present day.  I love my Brits and my Comrades in the motherland but a nice fat world war between those two and a somewhat rational and sane US president would sure make someone else the asshole for the next 50 years. And thats kinda what I want for the US. For us to stop being the asshole. 
twodot596,history,2015-03-11 11:35,The man was a drunk and definitely racist. He was a unyielding demonstration of the power of will. Winston Churchill is everything that was needed and his entire fate embodied. He **HAD** to be a stubborn iron willed bulldog. Its who he was made to be.    Not every person the world over will celebrate who he was but their lives have been impacted by his existence. 
joefurry,history,2015-03-11 11:41,"In terms of 'human history' I would say Stalingrad.   It had the most combatants and was the bloodiest battle of all time in absolute terms.  If the German's had won then it would have likely been all over for Russia. Germany would be able to take the oil in the Caucasus region and refocus efforts on taking Moscow.   As it was the Germans lost 1 million men and had no further strategic victories in the East.   Maybe the Western Allies would have beaten Germany but if Russia had fallen the war would probably seen a much heavier genocide and the Western Allies losses would have been much much higher. It's possible that they wouldn't have been able to win and the USA would have sued for peace rather than unconditional surrender.   This scenario is all laid out in the horrifying novel ""Fatherland"" by Robert Harris. "
BFGDoomer,history,2015-03-11 12:26,Stalingrad is a great choice. Very horrible battle too.
Bernardito,AskHistorians,2015-03-11 12:42,Don't be so certain that things would have gone that different. Roosevelt's thinking was in the face of reality just wishful thinking and while he kept pushing for it there was nothing stopping the French from returning to claim their colony once more in 1945.  FDR saw colonialism in pre-WWI as one of the reasons for that very war and he was also horrified by the treatment of the colonized population under the colonizers. This was also one of the reasons to why he was against the French from returning seeing their treatment of the Vietnamese as something negative.
